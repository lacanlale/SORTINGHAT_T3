Oppression, drought and religious differences all played key roles, but Marwa Al-Sabouni suggests another reason: architecture. Speaking to us over the Internet from Homs, where for the last six years she has watched the war tear her city apart, Al-Sabouni suggests that Syria's architecture divided its once tolerant and multicultural society into single-identity enclaves defined by class and religion. The country's future now depends on how it chooses to rebuild.","In this delightful talk, philosopher Yann Dall'Aglio explores the universal search for tenderness and connection in a world that's ever more focused on the individual. As it turns out, it's easier than you think. A wise and witty reflection on the state of love in the modern age. In French with subtitles.","Why, why, why does our education system look so similar to the way it did 50 years ago? Millions of students were failing then, as they are now -- and itâs because weâre clinging to a business model that clearly doesnât work. Education advocate Geoffrey Canada dares the system to look at the data, think about the customers and make systematic shifts in order to help greater numbers of kids excel. ","A clay cylinder covered in Akkadian cuneiform script, damaged and broken, the Cyrus Cylinder is a powerful symbol of religious tolerance and multi-culturalism. In this enthralling talk Neil MacGregor, Director of the British Museum, traces 2600 years of Middle Eastern history through this single object.",string

Early into Monday morning, three masked men entered the Tap Inn with guns. One of the robbers can be seen on the surveillance video cleaning out the cash register while the other two pointed their guns at bar patrons and the bartender. One couple, lost in each otherâs eyes, failed to notice the robbery as it took place right beside them, and continued on with their kissing. It was not until after the robbers left that the couple looked up.

Via elgrafico. mx: 6:58 PM  â   âCanât Stump the Trumpâ is an amateur YouTube channel where an anonymous college student mashed up news clips with 4chan memes to cheer on   Donald Trump, starting in the Republican primary  â   while simultaneously documenting his insane,    political ascent from an Alt Right perspective. Itâs crudely assembled, itâs vulgar, and itâs become an online campaign tradition as infamous as Matt Drudgeâs debate polls.  âComrade Stump,â as he calls himself on Twitter, created several memes that stuck for Trumpâs fan base. By making a dubstep song, âCentipedeâ by Knife Party, the theme song to the series, a nature documentary voiceover sampled in the prelude inspired Trump supporters to call themselves âcentipedesâ and ânimble navigatorsâ and crack jokes about Trump being a âpredatorâ with âhollow fangs. â Several other running jokes include air horns blaring after every Trump putdown or unfortunate event for his opponents, a video game sprite animation delivering a âkill shotâ on defeated foes, and overlaying the faces of political players on   movie clips such as Star Wars: Episode IIIâs climactic lightsaber fight.

Watch it below: 6:35 PM  â   In 1987, Nixon wrote Trump regarding a television appearance his wife, former First Lady Pat Nixon, greatly enjoyed. Trump had agreed to a profile on the popular show Donahue, airing in December of that year.  âAs you can imagine, she is an expert on politics and she predicts that whenever you decide to run for office you will be a winner!â the short letter read.  The letter became public as part of the release of a Donald Trump biography titled Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success. It would take nearly three decades for Trump to decide to run for office, proving the 37th president correct. On Tuesday, Donald Trump became   of the United States, sweeping Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton in reliably blue states like Michigan and Wisconsin. As Republican nominee, Nixon won the 1968 largely on the back of a campaign targeting   Americans who felt the Kennedy and Johnson administrations had allowed the government to descend into chaos, particularly in the context of the rudderless Vietnam war. These voters he dubbed the âSilent Majorityâ in a 1969 speech. Trumpâs campaign echoed many of the sentiments of that election, down to using the term to refer to those whose livelihoods were threatened or eliminated entirely by the growing global economy.

Back in September, Gallup presented the findings of an important research project that, in retrospect, ought to have prompted a lot more soul searching among members of the press. What they did was, over an extended period of time, survey people and ask them what they were hearing about the two candidates. The answer is that with regard to Hillary Clinton, they heard a lot about email. With regard to Trump, they heard about nothing in particular.

He spent the next five years in a   prison in Rhode Island. In 2005, Jonathan Peskin was a salesman in a small Connecticut town when he was stopped by police at a local hotel and accused of being a flasher, then charged with child kidnapping and molestation of a girl he did not know in a state he had not visited in years. At the time he was 43, had never been arrested and did not fit the profile of a typical pedophile. But he was a diabetic who hadnât eaten. The police denied his request for a lawyer, and he ended up pleading guilty to a crime he didnât commit during a   interrogation because his blood sugar bottomed out. He pleaded guilty to avoid a longer sentence, Curtis said. The damage to Peskin and his family was immeasurable. âWhen I was younger, at school, I didnât understand the justice system. I had no knowledge that this kind of thing could happen, but seeing the statistics, it happens all the time.â Curtis, who is 18, grew up being bullied. A month before her 13th birthday, she began to blog. But she is only now talking about her terrible family ordeal. âIâve recently decided to discuss this topic, which no one outside of my family and friends knows about,â Curtis said. âOne of the reasons I started my blog was to inspire other young adults to follow their dreams. But in reality, I started it as an outlet to escape the pain that came from the terrible thing that happened to him. â âIâd like to eventually start a charity for kids whose parents have been incarcerated, innocent or not,â she added. Growing up was tough. âWhen I was younger, at school, I didnât understand the justice system. I had no knowledge that this kind of thing could happen, but seeing the statistics, it happens all the time,â Curtis said. Blogging, Curtis said, âgave me an outlet to forget what was going on. â Every week, Curtis would go from Connecticut to Rhode Island with her mother to visit her father in jail. âIâd then have to go to school the next day and act like everything was normal. Clothing and fashion gave me a reason to wake up every morning and go to school without having the world crash down around me,â Curtis said. At first, Curtis only wrote about fashion. But at 14, she started writing about issues that were also of serious concern in the teen world, like bullying and eating disorders. âAt 14, I had more confidence. When I was younger, I was more insecure and ashamed. It took me a few years to find myself and to grow into myself and to start writing about things that could help other people too,â she said. At 14, Curtis said, she also started modeling, in part because âno one told me I could be successful as a writer. â Curtis worked out four hours a day, and developed an eating disorder, thanks in part to an agent who told her that she was âtoo fatâ and demanded that she email every piece of food that went into her mouth, every day. âFrom age 14 to 16, I developed a serious eating disorder. I was in a bad place, always on different diets. Finally, I realized that I would never be good enough for anyone but myself. â At 14, Curtis was bullied so severely  â   eating lunch in the bathroom because she couldnât face the   taunts  â   that one week she was too sick to even go to school. Thatâs when she had an epiphany. She randomly googled the first fashion house that came to mind, BCBG, and the word âpublic relations,â because she saw the word in People magazine. A name popped up. Curtis sent an email. âI knew that if I wanted to make it in fashion, I should go to Fashion Week, so I put together a paragraph about how I was a    blogger and how I wanted to inspire other girls to follow their dreams,â Curtis said. âThe publicist replied within seven minutes, and invited me to the show  â   and to see what it was like backstage. Iâve been going to Fashion Week ever since. â She now has British Airways as a sponsor for her blog,   and has added London Fashion Week as well as Paris Fashion Week to her repertoire. Istanbul, Milan and Tel Aviv are next. Curtis now has offices in Boston and New York, a   employee, and a second business running her own social media public relations firm. âOver the past two years, Iâve had around 10 clients. Brands contact me. They know they will get a lot of personal attention with no crazy expensive retainers,â she said, adding that her business has grown 80 percent in the past year alone. But her writing is not all fun and fashion. In one post that went viral on Streetscape. com, she wrote about her eating disorder: âDonât let food ruin your life. What you see in the mirror does not determine the type of person you are.   â¦     My hips will never be the size they were when I was 5 years old. Iâm okay with that. â","A man once described as a âperfect donorâ at an August, Georgia sperm bank and who fathered at least 36 children around the world is actually a mentally ill felon whose lies on his donor forms went undiscovered for more than a decade. The Toronto Star reported last week that    Chris Aggeles, known as Donor 9323 by the global sperm bank Xytex, purported to be a healthy man with an IQ of 160 who speaks five languages and is an acclaimed musician working on a Ph. D. degree in neuroscience engineering. But Aggeles is actually a college dropout who has been diagnosed with schizophrenia, bipolar and narcissistic personality disorder, according to the Star. The newspaper reported Aggeles also has a history of   with the law for burglary, disorderly conduct and driving under the influence. Families only began to unravel the discrepancy after Xytex inadvertently revealed Aggelesâ identity in an email. Now, three Canadian families with children between four and eight years old are suing the sperm bank, alleging the firm allowed Aggeles to continue selling his sperm even after they discovered he provided misinformation. The company, which used the donorâs sperm to conceive at least 36 children in the United States, Canada and Great Britain, maintains it did nothing wrong and said in an open letter that it relies on the honor system for donorsâ   medical history and personal information. Angie Collins, whose    son is among the children fathered by Aggeles and is involved in the lawsuit, told the Star she first learned of Aggelesâ medical history when she received a Facebook message from another woman who used his sperm. âIt just kept getting worse and worse,â Collins told the Guardian. âIt was like a dream turned nightmare in an instant. â While Collins said her son hasnât shown signs of mental illness, his life âcould just turn on a dime in puberty. â   KTLA","With exactitude based on firsthand,    experience, NR essayist David French has exposed one of the more maddening aspects of the Hillary Clinton   scandal: that if she had been Private First Class Clinton, her handling of classified material would have landed her in a heap of trouble. Likely: criminal charges, a court martial, and maybe even imprisonment. Last week David wrote: If Hillary Clinton was a soldier, she would lose her security clearance, face administrative action, and face the specter of criminal prosecution. Iâve not only seen the pattern, Iâve also participated in the process. Hereâs how it would work. You can read the âhereâs howâ here. Like David, you will come to the immediate conclusion: âThe double standards are painful. â There is so much to this staggering scandal: the sheer volume of transgressions perpetrated the relentless,   knowing lies the failure of the FBI to recommend prosecution the unethical actions of both the president and the attorney general and so much more. National Review is critical to the conservative movement  â   a movement it founded in 1955, a movement that it continues to sustain some 61 years later, courtesy of its team of exceptional writers. And, yes, its friends. To the subject matter at hand: If you are a fan of David French, or of Andy McCarthy, or Victor Davis Hanson, or Jonah Goldberg, Rich Lowry, Jay Nordlinger, Eliana Johnson, Shannen Coffin (more about him later this week) and countless other talented commentators, reporters, and influential polemicists, then support us. Why? Because we ache for very necessary and very needed financial aid so that we may continue to publish these great writers. These writers of terrific influence. Iâll ask: Which team makes a better case for the former secretary of stateâs absolute unsuitability for higher office? The answer: None. As Rich Lowry and I and others have said elsewhere and on other occasions, this enterprise can get just so far via standard industry practices, which range from selling magazine subscriptions to selling cruise cabins. Try as we might, and do, at the end of the day, there is a revenue shortfall. Thatâs been the case since 1958, at which time Bill Buckley turned to NR subscribers and asked them to become de facto partners in the cause of conservatism. They did then. They continue to do so now. And that is imperative. If you are a great fan of NRO and of its writers  â   if you come here frequently and feast on all NRO publishes, day in and out  â   then we urge you to make a donation. May I count on you for $50? How about $25, or even $10? A little more flush with cash? Then how about $100, or $250, or $500 or more? Whatever you give will go toward that which you know and we know is vital to the cause we share: the publishing and promulgation and distribution of unrivaled conservative wisdom, commentary, analysis, and reporting. The kind that you can find only at NRO. Please donate here. Your support is vital and needed. I implore especially those who frequent NRO the same way a Chicago Democrat votes (early and often!) to search your conscience and then your wallet to help keep Americaâs premier conservative website publishing Americaâs premier conservative writers.

Sheâs part of whatâs destroying America. ââ âRyan Bundy called Beck the âCarp lady,â referencing the fish   on her office wall.â âMost of Beckâs paraphernalia has been left unmoved, except for a space that was cleared on her desk for boxes of pizza and bullets.â âHere Ammon Bundy leads a prayer in the office:â âAmmon Bundy also fields phone calls from reporters, supporters, and local government officials.â âHow the occupation will end remains unclear, but the men are on edge that their holdout will be stormed at any moment.â âAs part of their initiative, the group has proposed changing the name and logo of the Malheur refuge, where migrating waterfowl come annually.â âWes Kjar, a    occupier from Utah, says he left a job on an oil rig to join the militia group. He met Ammon Bundy for the first time when he arrived in Oregon and now serves as a body guard.â âKjar said he would not hesitate to stand between Bundy and a bullet.â âAmmon Bundy said he was not sure how the siege would end, but said he would not resist arrest. On the other hand, he said wonât cooperate with any prosecution he deems unconstitutional. â] Militia members blocked roads into the Malheur Wildlife Refuge and have a guard stationed at a watchtower, but they have allowed reporters into much of the area. On Tuesday night, they allowed two Reuters reporters to photograph inside the federal building they have been occupying. On Thursday, Ammon Bundy met with Harney County Sheriff David Ward at the intersection of two remote rural roads for their first   meeting since Saturday. Despite shaking hands, an invitation for an escort out of Oregon was declined and a meeting for Friday was scheduled.  ",string

The job posting for employees to help build the platform (See the job ad  ) comes as Goldman is looking at ways to broaden its customer base outside the super wealthy, including making deeper inroads into new   businesses. The bank last year launched Marcus, its first major foray into consumer lending, as well as a complementary   platform after acquiring GE Capitalâs online bank. It also acquired Honest Dollar, an online retirement savings platform for small businesses and startups.  The robo platform would sit within the bankâs rapidly growing investment management division, according to the ad. The unit, which Goldman has been trying to build out in recent years to diversify its revenue, posted a record $1. 38 trillion in assets under supervision at the end of 2016.      Goldman has for years grappled with how to tap into the mass affluent segment, broadly defined as those with less than $1 million in investable assets, without diluting the brand of its private wealth business which is considered a jewel within the bank, according to people familiar with the matter. Goldmanâs U. S. private wealth business typically advises clients with an account size of around $50 million. Goldman has in the past considered expanding Ayco, a wealth advisory firm it purchased in 2003, as a way to push more deeply into the mass affluent segment, the people added.

"," The family of former FBI agent Robert Levinson, who went missing in Iran eight years ago, said on Tuesday it was âdesperate for answersâ on his whereabouts and expressed frustration at the information it had received from the Obama administration. Levinson, who disappeared while visiting Iranâs Kish Island in 2007, was not among the five American prisoners released by the Iranian government on Saturday as part of a prisoner swap with Washington.  His family said in a statement over the weekend that they were âdevastated,â adding: âWe are happy for the other families. But once again, Bob Levinson has been left behind.â In a speech on Sunday celebrating the release of the Americans, Obama said the U. S. government would ânot restâ until Levinson was found. U. S. Secretary of State John Kerry said in a Twitter post that Iran had agreed to deeper coordination to locate Levinson. Levinsonâs son, Dan, told CNN on Tuesday the family âcan only hope that they (U. S. officials) are really doing everything they can.â He said that for years âPresident Obama has promised that, Secretary Kerry has promised that, but it hasnât . .. given us results.â U. S. officials believe that Levinson, who suffered from diabetes, died in captivity after meeting with an   Islamic militant on Kish Island. Iranian officials have repeatedly denied knowledge of his disappearance or whereabouts. Robert Levinsonâs wife, Christine, told CNN on Tuesday that she had tried since November to arrange    meetings with   administration officials, including Obama, Kerry and national security advisor Susan Rice. âWeâre desperate for answers, and weâre really going to push hard, and weâre not going to go away,â Christine Levinson said. She said the family had received one phone call from a member of the Obama administration after the American prisonersâ release apologizing that they had not been warned ahead of time. In a separate interview on Fox News, Christine Levinson said, âwe need the United States government to work harder to bring him home.â White House spokesman Josh Earnest said on Tuesday the administration had repeatedly pressed Iranians for âas much information as they haveâ on Levinsonâs whereabouts and would continue to do so. Senior administration officials, including Obama personally, have been in touch with the Levinson family as recently as late December, he said. âWeâre obviously very sensitive to the concerns and rather raw feelings of the Levinson family,â Earnest said. U. S. Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on CNN that officials have been working to find Levinson and bring him back âthe entire time.â He said the administration was uncertain Levinson was still being held in Iran.

Three people were killed and a fourth wounded on Wednesday in a series of shootings in central Maine, according to State Police, who said that officers shot and killed the suspected gunman. "," Deutsche Bank ( ) agreed to pay $630 million in fines to U. S. and UK regulators for failing to prevent around $10 billion in suspicious trades being laundered out of Russia, settling a second major legal case this month. The scheme involved   mirror trades between the bankâs Moscow, London and New York offices from 2011 to 2015, in which it bought Russian   stocks in rubles on behalf of clients and sold the identical quantity of the same stocks at the same price through its London branch shortly afterwards. âThe offsetting trades here lacked economic purpose and could have been used to facilitate money laundering or enable other illicit conduct,â the New York Department of Financial Services said, which fined Deutsche Bank $425 million. âThe bank missed numerous opportunities to detect, investigate and stop the scheme due to extensive compliance failures, allowing the scheme to continue for years.â Britainâs Financial Conduct Authority separately fined Deutsche Bank 163 million pounds ($204 million) for failing to maintain an adequate   laundering controls between 2012 and 2015, allowing customers to transfer billions from Russia to offshore bank accounts âin a manner that is highly suggestive of financial crimeâ. It is the largest financial penalty for anti   controls failings yet imposed by the FCA or its predecessor, the Financial Services Authority.  The Russian case settlements, on the heels of a $7. 2 billion agreement with the U. S. Department of Justice earlier this month over the misselling of   securities, lift much of the uncertainty swirling around the bank over its exposure to fines and enforcement. Deutsche Bank said the   settlement amounts were âmaterially reflectedâ in existing litigation reserves. It added, however, it was still cooperating with other regulators and authorities who had their own ongoing investigations. Its shares rose 1. 5 percent to the top of Germanyâs   index   at 18. 88 euros in early trade. The U. S. Department of Justice, which also has been investigating the suspicious trades, is not party to the deal. A spokesman for the department declined to comment on the status of its probe. Reuters reported earlier that Deutsche Bank was poised to settle over the trades. The New York regulator, which licenses and supervises the New York branch, found Deutsche Bank conducted its business in an unsafe and unsound manner in violation of state banking law. The trade of a Russian blue chip stock, typically valued at between $2 million to $3 million an order, was cleared through the bankâs New York operations, with the sellers typically paying in U. S. dollars, DFS said. In addition to the penalty, Deutsche is required to retain an independent monitor to review the bankâs compliance programs. Deutsche Bank disclosed last September that it had taken disciplinary measures against certain employees as part of an investigation of the trades and would continue to do so. It also cut back on its investment banking activities in Russia. Mondayâs consent order found Deutsche Bankâs Moscow traders facilitated the scheme, with most of the trades placed by a single trader representing both sides of the transaction.  Deutscheâs Moscow traders did not question the suspicious trades because it made for easy commissions when their Russian business had slowed, the regulator found. The bank is due to report   financial results on Thursday.

The US   even appeared to allude to his reality TV show The Apprentice as he denied reports that his transition process is in turmoil and plagued by infighting. Trump waged an unprecedented   war against the media during his election campaign, banning some organisations from his rallies and regularly inciting his supporters to boo and jeer reporters.

Whereas Barack Obama gave his first press conference three days after his election in 2008, Trump is yet to do so, instead giving a primetime TV interview and unleashing a barrage of tweets, yet again taking the US presidency into uncharted waters. âVery organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions,â he posted on Twitter late on Tuesday. âI am the only one who knows who the finalists are!â His reference to âthe finalistsâ seemed to deliberately evoke The Apprentice, in which contestants battled each other for a chance to work at his business and he told those who fell short: âYouâre fired!â The Twitter storm resumed early on Wednesday morning when he denied media reports that his three adult children  â   Don Jr, Eric and Ivanka  â   would be receiving security clearances, raising potential conflicts of interest. âI am not trying to get âtop level security clearanceâ for my children. This was a typically false news story. â And then he singled out the New York Times, which during the campaign revealed how he may have avoided paying taxes for 18 years and which endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. This week the paper has reported on disarray in the transition and said that, while the presidents of Egypt and Israel got through to Trump quickly by phone, UK prime minister Theresa May had to wait 24 hours. âThe failing @nytimes story is so totally wrong on transition,â Trump tweeted. âIt is going so smoothly. Also, I have spoken to many foreign leaders. â He added: âI have recieved [sic] and taken calls from many foreign leaders despite what the failing @nytimes said. Russia, U. K. China, Saudi Arabia, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and more. I am always available to them. @nytimes is just upset that they looked like fools in their coverage of me. â  His decision to mention Russia first will not have escaped critics of Trumpâs apparent admiration for president Vladimir Putin. The New York Times pointed out that it had reported that Trump had taken calls from the leaders of Egypt, Israel, Russia and Britain, but said they had been âconducted haphazardlyâ and without the state department guidance that is typical for such conversations. Trumpâs     style was met with criticism. David Frum, a former speechwriter for George W Bush, tweeted: âIt will never stop being insane that the   of the United States foams at his critics on Twitter. â It is fine to publish a list of foreign leaders who called to congratulate him, Frum added: âBut to toss names out there in a Twitter rage to answer a perceived media slight?! When does President Trump compromise an important secret?â Further concerns were raised about Trumpâs handling of the media when he broke with protocol on Tuesday night, going out to dinner at a steakhouse after his transition team had told journalists he would not be out in public the rest of the day. Trump reportedly received a standing ovation and cheers on arriving at 21 Club in midtown Manhattan. The White House Correspondentsâ Association said it was âunacceptableâ that Trump was traveling without a regular pool of journalists to inform the public of his whereabouts. A protective pool of journalists is supposed to join the president or  âs motorcade to record their whereabouts and be on hand in the event of breaking news. The Trump team has said it plans to respect the traditions of press access at the White House. Jeff Mason, president of the White House Correspondents Association, insisted: âThe time to act on that promise is now. Pool reporters are in place in New York to cover the   as he assembles his new administration. It is critical that they be allowed to do their jobs. â On Wednesday, Jason Miller, a spokesperson for Trump, admitted that there was room for improvement. âLast night probably was an example where there could have been a little bit better communication,â he told reporters. âBut again, our goal going forward is to get you guys the best information in a timely fashion. âBut I would also say  â   would also stand up for the   and say that, for some in the media, unless theyâre actually sitting at the table, seeing if heâs getting the chicken or the fish, that they will never be happy. And there always needs to be some kind of balance for respecting some degree of privacy. But to your initial point, we do think that there will be improved communication and our goal is to make sure that something like last night doesnât happen again. â Asked when the billionaire businessman would do a press conference, Kellyanne Conway, his campaign manager, replied: âShortly, I would say. Some time soon. But obviously heâs meeting with  â   talking to heads of state and possible members of his cabinet and senior team, filling out his senior leadership team. A lot of activity going on upstairs. â On a conference call with reporters Wednesday night, Miller and RNC strategist Sean Spicer announced that landing teams would be deployed in the coming days to start the transition process and noted that all of those joining landing teams would sign a pledge to not serve as a lobbyist at the federal and state level for the next five years.  They also noted several of the meetings that the   had held with potential cabinet members on Wednesday, including senator Jeff Sessions, general Mike Flynn, representative Tom Price, representativeMike Pompeo and charter school leader Eva Moskowitz. They added that Trump is expected to meet Thursday with governor Nikki Haley, governor Rick Scott and former secretary of state Henry Kissinger, among others. Former House speaker Newt Gingrich said the media would have to adapt to Trumpâs â  CEOâ style. âIt probably confuses the traditional political press because they apply traditional standards and you canât do that with Trump,â he told Fox News.  Gingrich added that he was â100%â sure he did not want a cabinet post as transition talks continued at Trump Tower, where the tycoonâs second wife, Marla Maples, was spotted on Tuesday afternoon. The departure of former US representative Mike Rogers as a national security adviser followed the removal of New Jersey governor Chris Christie as head of Trumpâs transition team in favour of    Mike Pence, who did not sign a memorandum of understanding with Barack Obamaâs White House until Tuesday night. The appointment of Steve Bannon, a media executive accused of   ties, and the role of Trumpâs    Jared Kushner have fuelled discontent. On Wednesday Bernie Sanders, the leftwing Democrat who ran against Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic primary, called the appointment of Bannon âtotally unacceptableâ.  âIn a democratic society we can disagree all we want over issues, but racism and bigotry cannot be part of any public policy,â Sanders aid. âThe appointment of Mr Bannon by Mr Trump must be rescinded. â Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani appears to be haggling for the prize job of secretary of state. But the transition team is reviewing Giulianiâs paid consulting work for foreign governments including Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, the Associated Press reported. He is also under scrutiny over speeches he made on behalf of the   Khalq, a fringe Iranian dissident group. The group, which operates in exile, was designated a foreign terrorist organization by the US state department in 1997 for its long and bloody history, including its involvement in the killing of Americans in Iran in the 1970s. Speaking fees paid by several MEK front groups to Giuliani and other politicians potentially broke laws on Americans receiving money from designated terrorist organisations. Another visitor to Trump Tower on Wednesday was current New York mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat. He said he wanted to give Trump a feel of concerns everyone is feeling about his presidency. âI talked to him about concerns of potential deportations, I gave him the perspective of the NYPD [New York police department],â De Blasio said, describing New York âthe ultimate city of immigrants. â There are more than 900 Muslim members of the NYPD, the mayor said, and citizens rely on their willingness to protect the city. âI let him know that so many New Yorkers were fearful and that more had to be done to show that this country can heal, that people be respected. â De Blasio added: âEven though I have very real differences with the   he is a New Yorker, I do think he loves this city. â ","A French ship has detected signals from a flight recorder for EgyptAir MS804, the plane that crashed into the Mediterranean nearly two weeks ago, according to Egyptian officials and a French company. Egypts Civil Aviation Ministry said Wednesday a ship picked up pings from deep underwater that seemed to be either the data or voice recorder. A statement from Alseamar confirmed that the ship Laplace picked up a signal Wednesday, less than a day after it started searching for the recorders, The Associated Press reports. âThe French air accident investigation agency BEA said itâs impossible to determine from the signals whether it is the flightâs data or voice recorder,â the AP noted. The clock is ticking for search teams to find the recorders, also known as âblack boxes,â Reuters reports: âWithout the black boxes, say investigators and aviation disaster experts, there is not enough information to determine what went wrong or whether the plane was brought down deliberately. âThe recorders are designed to emit acoustic signals for 30 days after a crash, giving search teams fewer than three weeks to spot them in waters up to   deep, which is on the edge of their range.â The plane went missing on May 19, en route from Paris to Cairo, without sending a distress signal. The next day, debris from the flight was discovered north of Alexandria and investigators determined the plane crashed into the Mediterranean. All 66 people aboard are presumed dead. The cause of the crash is unknown. Investigators have previously said they have not ruled out the possibility of terrorism or of a technical malfunction.",string

Architects and designers tend to focus exclusively on these. They use these to design with and they design for them, which is why we end up sitting in restaurants that look like this â (loud crowd noise) â and sound like this, shouting from a foot away to try and be heard by our dinner companion, or why we get on airplanes â (flight attendant announcements) â which cost 200 million pounds, with somebody talking through an old-fashioned telephone handset on a cheap stereo system, making us jump out of our skins.We're designing environments that make us crazy. (Laughter) And it's not just our quality of life which suffers. It's our health, our social behavior, and our productivity as well.How does this work? Well, two ways. First of all, ambience. I have a whole TEDTalk about this. Sound affects us physiologically, psychologically, cognitively and behaviorally all the time. The sound around us is affecting us even though we're not conscious of it. There's a second way though, as well. That's interference. Communication requires sending and receiving, and I have another whole TEDTalk about the importance of conscious listening, but I can send as well as I like, and you can be brilliant conscious listeners. If the space I'm sending it in is not effective, that communication can't happen.Spaces tend to include noise and acoustics. A room like this has acoustics, this one very good acoustics. Many rooms are not so good. Let me give you some examples from a couple of areas which I think we all care about: health and education. (Hospital noises) When I was visiting my terminally ill father in a hospital, I was asking myself, how does anybody get well in a place that sounds like this? Hospital sound is getting worse all the time. Noise levels in hospitals have doubled in the last few years, and it affects not just the patients but also the people working there. I think we would like for dispensing errors to be zero, wouldn't we? And yet, as noise levels go up, so do the errors in dispensing made by the staff in hospitals. Most of all, though, it affects the patients, and that could be you, it could be me. Sleep is absolutely crucial for recovery. It's when we regenerate, when we rebuild ourselves, and with threatening noise like this going on, your body, even if you are able to sleep, your body is telling you, ""I'm under threat. This is dangerous."" And the quality of sleep is degraded, and so is our recovery. There are just huge benefits to come from designing for the ears in our health care. This is an area I intend to take on this year.Education. When I see a classroom that looks like this, can you imagine how this sounds? I am forced to ask myself a question. (""Do architects have ears?"") (Laughter) Now, that's a little unfair. Some of my best friends are architects. (Laughter) And they definitely do have ears. But I think sometimes they don't use them when they're designing buildings. Here's a case in point. This is a 32-million-pound flagship academy school which was built quite recently in the U.K. and designed by one of Britain's top architects. Unfortunately, it was designed like a corporate headquarters, with a vast central atrium and classrooms leading off it with no back walls at all. The children couldn't hear their teachers. They had to go back in and spend 600,000 pounds putting the walls in. Let's stop this madness of open plan classrooms right now, please.It's not just these modern buildings which suffer. Old-fashioned classrooms suffer too. A study in Florida just a few years ago found that if you're sitting where this photograph was taken in the classroom, row four, speech intelligibility is just 50 percent. Children are losing one word in two. Now that doesn't mean they only get half their education, but it does mean they have to work very hard to join the dots and understand what's going on.This is affected massively by reverberation time, how reverberant a room is. In a classroom with a reverberation time of 1.2 seconds, which is pretty common, this is what it sounds like.(Inaudible echoing voice)Not so good, is it? If you take that 1.2 seconds down to 0.4 seconds by installing acoustic treatments, sound absorbing materials and so forth, this is what you get.Voice: In language, infinitely many words can be written with a small set of letters. In arithmetic, infinitely many numbers can be composed from just a few digits with the help of the simple zero.Julian Treasure: What a difference. Now that education you would receive, and thanks to the British acoustician Adrian James for those simulations. The signal was the same, the background noise was the same. All that changed was the acoustics of the classroom in those two examples.If education can be likened to watering a garden, which is a fair metaphor, sadly, much of the water is evaporating before it reaches the flowers, especially for some groups, for example, those with hearing impairment. Now that's not just deaf children. That could be any child who's got a cold, glue ear, an ear infection, even hay fever. On a given day, one in eight children fall into that group, on any given day. Then you have children for whom English is a second language, or whatever they're being taught in is a second language. In the U.K., that's more than 10 percent of the school population. And finally, after Susan Cain's wonderful TEDTalk in February, we know that introverts find it very difficult to relate when they're in a noisy environment doing group work. Add those up. That is a lot of children who are not receiving their education properly.It's not just the children who are affected, though. (Noisy conversation) This study in Germany found the average noise level in classrooms is 65 decibels. I have to really raise my voice to talk over 65 decibels of sound, and teachers are not just raising their voices. This chart maps the teacher's heart rate against the noise level. Noise goes up, heart rate goes up. That is not good for you. In fact, 65 decibels is the very level at which this big survey of all the evidence on noise and health found that, that is the threshold for the danger of myocardial infarction. To you and me, that's a heart attack. It may not be pushing the boat out too far to suggest that many teachers are losing significant life expectancy by teaching in environments like that day after day.What does it cost to treat a classroom down to that 0.4-second reverberation time? Two and a half thousand pounds. And the Essex study which has just been done in the U.K., which incidentally showed that when you do this, you do not just make a room that's suitable for hearing-impaired children, you make a room where behavior improves, and results improve significantly, this found that sending a child out of area to a school that does have such a room, if you don't have one, costs 90,000 pounds a year. I think the economics are pretty clear on this.I'm glad that debate is happening on this. I just moderated a major conference in London a few weeks ago called Sound Education, which brought together top acousticians, government people, teachers, and so forth. We're at last starting to debate this issue, and the benefits that are available for designing for the ears in education, unbelievable. Out of that conference, incidentally, also came a free app which is designed to help children study if they're having to work at home, for example, in a noisy kitchen. And that's free out of that conference.Let's broaden the perspective a little bit and look at cities. We have urban planners. Where are the urban sound planners? I don't know of one in the world, and the opportunity is there to transform our experience in our cities. The World Health Organization estimates that a quarter of Europe's population is having its sleep degraded by noise in cities. We can do better than that.And in our offices, we spend a lot of time at work. Where are the office sound planners? People who say, don't sit that team next to this team, because they like noise and they need quiet. Or who say, don't spend all your budget on a huge screen in the conference room, and then place one tiny microphone in the middle of a table for 30 people. (Laughter) If you can hear me, you can understand me without seeing me. If you can see me without hearing me, that does not work. So office sound is a huge area, and incidentally, noise in offices has been shown to make people less helpful, less enjoy their teamwork, and less productive at work.Finally, we have homes. We use interior designers. Where are the interior sound designers? Hey, let's all be interior sound designers, take on listening to our rooms and designing sound that's effective and appropriate.My friend Richard Mazuch, an architect in London, coined the phrase ""invisible architecture."" I love that phrase. It's about designing, not appearance, but experience, so that we have spaces that sound as good as they look, that are fit for purpose, that improve our quality of life, our health and well being, our social behavior and our productivity.It's time to start designing for the ears. Thank you. (Applause) (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)","The human voice: It's the instrument we all play. It's the most powerful sound in the world, probably. It's the only one that can start a war or say ""I love you."" And yet many people have the experience that when they speak, people don't listen to them. And why is that? How can we speak powerfully to make change in the world?What I'd like to suggest, there are a number of habits that we need to move away from. I've assembled for your pleasure here seven deadly sins of speaking. I'm not pretending this is an exhaustive list, but these seven, I think, are pretty large habits that we can all fall into.First, gossip. Speaking ill of somebody who's not present. Not a nice habit, and we know perfectly well the person gossiping, five minutes later, will be gossiping about us.Second, judging. We know people who are like this in conversation, and it's very hard to listen to somebody if you know that you're being judged and found wanting at the same time.Third, negativity. You can fall into this. My mother, in the last years of her life, became very negative, and it's hard to listen. I remember one day, I said to her, ""It's October 1 today,"" and she said, ""I know, isn't it dreadful?""(Laughter)It's hard to listen when somebody's that negative.(Laughter)And another form of negativity, complaining. Well, this is the national art of the U.K. It's our national sport. We complain about the weather, sport, about politics, about everything, but actually, complaining is viral misery. It's not spreading sunshine and lightness in the world.Excuses.We've all met this guy. Maybe we've all been this guy. Some people have a blamethrower. They just pass it on to everybody else and don't take responsibility for their actions, and again, hard to listen to somebody who is being like that.Penultimate, the sixth of the seven, embroidery, exaggeration. It demeans our language, actually, sometimes. For example, if I see something that really is awesome, what do I call it?(Laughter)And then, of course, this exaggeration becomes lying, and we don't want to listen to people we know are lying to us.And finally, dogmatism. The confusion of facts with opinions. When those two things get conflated, you're listening into the wind. You know, somebody is bombarding you with their opinions as if they were true. It's difficult to listen to that.So here they are, seven deadly sins of speaking. These are things I think we need to avoid. But is there a positive way to think about this? Yes, there is. I'd like to suggest that there are four really powerful cornerstones, foundations, that we can stand on if we want our speech to be powerful and to make change in the world. Fortunately, these things spell a word. The word is ""hail,"" and it has a great definition as well. I'm not talking about the stuff that falls from the sky and hits you on the head. I'm talking about this definition, to greet or acclaim enthusiastically, which is how I think our words will be received if we stand on these four things.So what do they stand for? See if you can guess. The H, honesty, of course, being true in what you say, being straight and clear. The A is authenticity, just being yourself. A friend of mine described it as standing in your own truth, which I think is a lovely way to put it. The I is integrity, being your word, actually doing what you say, and being somebody people can trust. And the L is love. I don't mean romantic love, but I do mean wishing people well, for two reasons. First of all, I think absolute honesty may not be what we want. I mean, my goodness, you look ugly this morning. Perhaps that's not necessary. Tempered with love, of course, honesty is a great thing. But also, if you're really wishing somebody well, it's very hard to judge them at the same time. I'm not even sure you can do those two things simultaneously. So hail.Also, now that's what you say, and it's like the old song, it is what you say, it's also the way that you say it. You have an amazing toolbox. This instrument is incredible, and yet this is a toolbox that very few people have ever opened. I'd like to have a little rummage in there with you now and just pull a few tools out that you might like to take away and play with, which will increase the power of your speaking.Register, for example. Now, falsetto register may not be very useful most of the time, but there's a register in between. I'm not going to get very technical about this for any of you who are voice coaches. You can locate your voice, however. So if I talk up here in my nose, you can hear the difference. If I go down here in my throat, which is where most of us speak from most of the time. But if you want weight, you need to go down here to the chest. You hear the difference? We vote for politicians with lower voices, it's true, because we associate depth with power and with authority. That's register.Then we have timbre. It's the way your voice feels. Again, the research shows that we prefer voices which are rich, smooth, warm, like hot chocolate. Well if that's not you, that's not the end of the world, because you can train. Go and get a voice coach. And there are amazing things you can do with breathing, with posture, and with exercises to improve the timbre of your voice.Then prosody. I love prosody. This is the sing-song, the meta-language that we use in order to impart meaning. It's root one for meaning in conversation. People who speak all on one note are really quite hard to listen to if they don't have any prosody at all. That's where the word ""monotonic"" comes from, or monotonous, monotone. Also, we have repetitive prosody now coming in, where every sentence ends as if it were a question when it's actually not a question, it's a statement?(Laughter)And if you repeat that one, it's actually restricting your ability to communicate through prosody, which I think is a shame, so let's try and break that habit.Pace.I can get very excited by saying something really quickly, or I can slow right down to emphasize, and at the end of that, of course, is our old friend silence. There's nothing wrong with a bit of silence in a talk, is there? We don't have to fill it with ums and ahs. It can be very powerful.Of course, pitch often goes along with pace to indicate arousal, but you can do it just with pitch. Where did you leave my keys? (Higher pitch) Where did you leave my keys? So, slightly different meaning in those two deliveries.And finally, volume. (Loud) I can get really excited by using volume. Sorry about that, if I startled anybody. Or, I can have you really pay attention by getting very quiet. Some people broadcast the whole time. Try not to do that. That's called sodcasting,(Laughter)Imposing your sound on people around you carelessly and inconsiderately. Not nice.Of course, where this all comes into play most of all is when you've got something really important to do. It might be standing on a stage like this and giving a talk to people. It might be proposing marriage, asking for a raise, a wedding speech. Whatever it is, if it's really important, you owe it to yourself to look at this toolbox and the engine that it's going to work on, and no engine works well without being warmed up. Warm up your voice.Actually, let me show you how to do that. Would you all like to stand up for a moment? I'm going to show you the six vocal warm-up exercises that I do before every talk I ever do. Any time you're going to talk to anybody important, do these. First, arms up, deep breath in, and sigh out, ahhhhh, like that. One more time. Ahhhh, very good. Now we're going to warm up our lips, and we're going to go Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba. Very good. And now, brrrrrrrrrr, just like when you were a kid. Brrrr. Now your lips should be coming alive. We're going to do the tongue next with exaggerated la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. Beautiful. You're getting really good at this. And then, roll an R. Rrrrrrr. That's like champagne for the tongue. Finally, and if I can only do one, the pros call this the siren. It's really good. It starts with ""we"" and goes to ""aw."" The ""we"" is high, the ""aw"" is low. So you go, weeeaawww, weeeaawww.Fantastic. Give yourselves a round of applause. Take a seat, thank you.(Applause)Next time you speak, do those in advance.Now let me just put this in context to close. This is a serious point here. This is where we are now, right? We speak not very well to people who simply aren't listening in an environment that's all about noise and bad acoustics. I have talked about that on this stage in different phases. What would the world be like if we were speaking powerfully to people who were listening consciously in environments which were actually fit for purpose? Or to make that a bit larger, what would the world be like if we were creating sound consciously and consuming sound consciously and designing all our environments consciously for sound? That would be a world that does sound beautiful, and one where understanding would be the norm, and that is an idea worth spreading.Thank you.(Applause)","So, a big question that we're facing now and have been for quite a number of years now: are we at risk of a nuclear attack? Now, there's a bigger question that's probably actually more important than that, is the notion of permanently eliminating the possibility of a nuclear attack, eliminating the threat altogether. And I would like to make a case to you that over the years since we first developed atomic weaponry, until this very moment, we've actually lived in a dangerous nuclear world that's characterized by two phases, which I'm going to go through with you right now.First of all, we started off the nuclear age in 1945. The United States had developed a couple of atomic weapons through the Manhattan Project, and the idea was very straightforward: we would use the power of the atom to end the atrocities and the horror of this unending World War II that we'd been involved in in Europe and in the Pacific. And in 1945, we were the only nuclear power. We had a few nuclear weapons, two of which we dropped on Japan, in Hiroshima, a few days later in Nagasaki, in August 1945, killing about 250,000 people between those two.And for a few years, we were the only nuclear power on Earth. But by 1949, the Soviet Union had decided it was unacceptable to have us as the only nuclear power, and they began to match what the United States had developed. And from 1949 to 1985 was an extraordinary time of a buildup of a nuclear arsenal that no one could possibly have imagined back in the 1940s. So by 1985 â each of those red bombs up here is equivalent of a thousands warheads â the world had 65,000 nuclear warheads, and seven members of something that came to be known as the ""nuclear club.""And it was an extraordinary time, and I am going to go through some of the mentality that we â that Americans and the rest of the world were experiencing. But I want to just point out to you that 95 percent of the nuclear weapons at any particular time since 1985 â going forward, of course â were part of the arsenals of the United States and the Soviet Union. After 1985, and before the break up of the Soviet Union, we began to disarm from a nuclear point of view. We began to counter-proliferate, and we dropped the number of nuclear warheads in the world to about a total of 21,000. It's a very difficult number to deal with, because what we've done is we've quote unquote ""decommissioned"" some of the warheads. They're still probably usable. They could be ""re-commissioned,"" but the way they count things, which is very complicated, we think we have about a third of the nuclear weapons we had before. But we also, in that period of time, added two more members to the nuclear club: Pakistan and North Korea.So we stand today with a still fully armed nuclear arsenal among many countries around the world, but a very different set of circumstances. So I'm going to talk about a nuclear threat story in two chapters. Chapter one is 1949 to 1991, when the Soviet Union broke up, and what we were dealing with, at that point and through those years, was a superpowers' nuclear arms race. It was characterized by a nation-versus-nation, very fragile standoff. And basically, we lived for all those years, and some might argue that we still do, in a situation of being on the brink, literally, of an apocalyptic, planetary calamity. It's incredible that we actually lived through all that.We were totally dependent during those years on this amazing acronym, which is MAD. It stands for mutually assured destruction. So it meant if you attacked us, we would attack you virtually simultaneously, and the end result would be a destruction of your country and mine. So the threat of my own destruction kept me from launching a nuclear attack on you. That's the way we lived. And the danger of that, of course, is that a misreading of a radar screen could actually cause a counter-launch, even though the first country had not actually launched anything. During this chapter one, there was a high level of public awareness about the potential of nuclear catastrophe, and an indelible image was implanted in our collective minds that, in fact, a nuclear holocaust would be absolutely globally destructive and could, in some ways, mean the end of civilization as we know it. So this was chapter one.Now the odd thing is that even though we knew that there would be that kind of civilization obliteration, we engaged in America in a series â and in fact, in the Soviet Union â in a series of response planning. It was absolutely incredible. So premise one is we'd be destroying the world, and then premise two is, why don't we get prepared for it? So what we offered ourselves was a collection of things. I'm just going to go skim through a few things, just to jog your memories. If you're born after 1950, this is just â consider this entertainment, otherwise it's memory lane.This was Bert the Turtle. (Video) This was basically an attempt to teach our schoolchildren that if we did get engaged in a nuclear confrontation and atomic war, then we wanted our school children to kind of basically duck and cover. That was the principle. You â there would be a nuclear conflagration about to hit us, and if you get under your desk, things would be OK.(Laughter)I didn't do all that well in psychiatry in medical school, but I was interested, and I think this was seriously delusional.(Laughter)Secondly, we told people to go down in their basements and build a fallout shelter. Maybe it would be a study when we weren't having an atomic war, or you could use it as a TV room, or, as many teenagers found out, a very, very safe place for a little privacy with your girlfriend. And actually â so there are multiple uses of the bomb shelters. Or you could buy a prefabricated bomb shelter that you could simply bury in the ground. Now, the bomb shelters at that point â let's say you bought a prefab one â it would be a few hundred dollars, maybe up to 500, if you got a fancy one. Yet, what percentage of Americans do you think ever had a bomb shelter in their house? What percentage lived in a house with a bomb shelter?Less than two percent. About 1.4 percent of the population, as far as anyone knows, did anything, either making a space in their basement or actually building a bomb shelter. Many buildings, public buildings, around the country â this is New York City â had these little civil defense signs, and the idea was that you would run into one of these shelters and be safe from the nuclear weaponry. And one of the greatest governmental delusions of all time was something that happened in the early days of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, as we now know, and are well aware of their behaviors from Katrina. Here is their first big public announcement. They would propose â actually there were about six volumes written on this â a crisis relocation plan that was dependent upon the United States having three to four days warning that the Soviets were going to attack us. So the goal was to evacuate the target cities. We would move people out of the target cities into the countryside.And I'm telling you, I actually testified at the Senate about the absolute ludicrous idea that we would actually evacuate, and actually have three or four days' warning. It was just completely off the wall. Turns out that they had another idea behind it, even though this was â they were telling the public it was to save us. The idea was that we would force the Soviets to re-target their nuclear weapons â very expensive â and potentially double their arsenal, to not only take out the original site, but take out sites where people were going. This was what apparently, as it turns out, was behind all this. It was just really, really frightening.The main point here is we were dealing with a complete disconnect from reality. The civil defense programs were disconnected from the reality of what we'd see in all-out nuclear war. So organizations like Physicians for Social Responsibility, around 1979, started saying this a lot publicly. They would do a bombing run. They'd go to your city, and they'd say, ""Here's a map of your city. Here's what's going to happen if we get a nuclear hit."" So no possibility of medical response to, or meaningful preparedness for all-out nuclear war. So we had to prevent nuclear war if we expected to survive. This disconnect was never actually resolved. And what happened was â when we get in to chapter two of the nuclear threat era, which started back in 1945.Chapter two starts in 1991. When the Soviet Union broke up, we effectively lost that adversary as a potential attacker of the United States, for the most part. It's not completely gone. I'm going to come back to that. But from 1991 through the present time, emphasized by the attacks of 2001, the idea of an all-out nuclear war has diminished and the idea of a single event, act of nuclear terrorism is what we have instead. Although the scenario has changed very considerably, the fact is that we haven't changed our mental image of what a nuclear war means. So I'm going to tell you what the implications of that are in just a second. So, what is a nuclear terror threat? And there's four key ingredients to describing that.First thing is that the global nuclear weapons, in the stockpiles that I showed you in those original maps, happen to be not uniformly secure. And it's particularly not secure in the former Soviet Union, now in Russia. There are many, many sites where warheads are stored and, in fact, lots of sites where fissionable materials, like highly enriched uranium and plutonium, are absolutely not safe. They're available to be bought, stolen, whatever. They're acquirable, let me put it that way. From 1993 through 2006, the International Atomic Energy Agency documented 175 cases of nuclear theft, 18 of which involved highly enriched uranium or plutonium, the key ingredients to make a nuclear weapon. The global stockpile of highly enriched uranium is about 1,300, at the low end, to about 2,100 metric tons. More than 100 megatons of this is stored in particularly insecure Russian facilities. How much of that do you think it would take to actually build a 10-kiloton bomb? Well, you need about 75 pounds of it.So, what I'd like to show you is what it would take to hold 75 pounds of highly enriched uranium. This is not a product placement. It's just â in fact, if I was Coca Cola, I'd be pretty distressed about this â (Laughter) â but basically, this is it.This is what you would need to steal or buy out of that 100-metric-ton stockpile that's relatively insecure to create the type of bomb that was used in Hiroshima. Now you might want to look at plutonium as another fissionable material that you might use in a bomb. That â you'd need 10 to 13 pounds of plutonium. Now, plutonium, 10 to 13 pounds: this. This is enough plutonium to create a Nagasaki-size atomic weapon. Now this situation, already I â you know, I don't really like thinking about this, although somehow I got myself a job where I have to think about it. So the point is that we're very, very insecure in terms of developing this material. The second thing is, what about the know-how?And there's a lot of controversy about whether terror organizations have the know-how to actually make a nuclear weapon. Well, there's a lot of know-how out there. There's an unbelievable amount of know-how out there. There's detailed information on how to assemble a nuclear weapon from parts. There's books about how to build a nuclear bomb. There are plans for how to create a terror farm where you could actually manufacture and develop all the components and assemble it. All of this information is relatively available. If you have an undergraduate degree in physics, I would suggest â although I don't, so maybe it's not even true â but something close to that would allow you, with the information that's currently available, to actually build a nuclear weapon.The third element of the nuclear terror threat is that, who would actually do such a thing? Well, what we're seeing now is a level of terrorism that involves individuals who are highly organized. They are very dedicated and committed. They are stateless. Somebody once said, Al Qaeda does not have a return address, so if they attack us with a nuclear weapon, what's the response, and to whom is the response? And they're retaliation-proof. Since there is no real retribution possible that would make any difference, since there are people willing to actually give up their lives in order to do a lot of damage to us, it becomes apparent that the whole notion of this mutually assured destruction would not work.Here is Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, and Sulaiman was a key lieutenant of Osama Bin Laden. He wrote many, many times statements to this effect: ""we have the right to kill four million Americans, two million of whom should be children."" And we don't have to go overseas to find people willing to do harm, for whatever their reasons. McVeigh and Nichols, and the Oklahoma City attack in the 1990s was a good example of homegrown terrorists. What if they had gotten their hands on a nuclear weapon? The fourth element is that the high-value U.S. targets are accessible, soft and plentiful.This would be a talk for another day, but the level of the preparedness that the United States has achieved since 9/11 of '01 is unbelievably inadequate. What you saw after Katrina is a very good indicator of how little prepared the United States is for any kind of major attack. Seven million ship cargo containers come into the United States every year. Five to seven percent only are inspected â five to seven percent.This is Alexander Lebed, who was a general that worked with Yeltsin, who talked about, and presented to Congress, this idea that the Russians had developed â these suitcase bombs. They were very low yield â 0.1 to one kiloton, Hiroshima was around 13 kilotons â but enough to do an unbelievable amount of damage. And Lebed came to the United States and told us that many, many â more than 80 of the suitcase bombs were actually not accountable. And they look like this. They're basically very simple arrangements. You put the elements into a suitcase. It becomes very portable. The suitcase can be conveniently dropped in your trunk of your car. You take it wherever you want to take it, and you can detonate it.You don't want to build a suitcase bomb, and you happen to get one of those insecure nuclear warheads that exist. This is the size of the ""Little Boy"" bomb that was dropped at Hiroshima. It was 9.8 feet long, weighed 8,800 pounds. You go down to your local rent-a-truck and for 50 bucks or so, you rent a truck that's got the right capacity, and you take your bomb, you put it in the truck and you're ready to go. It could happen. But what it would mean and who would survive? You can't get an exact number for that kind of probability, but what I'm trying to say is that we have all the elements of that happening. Anybody who dismisses the thought of a nuclear weapon being used by a terrorist is kidding themselves.I think there's a lot of people in the intelligence community â a lot of people who deal with this work in general think it's almost inevitable, unless we do certain things to really try to defuse the risk, like better interdiction, better prevention, better fixing, you know, better screening of cargo containers that are coming into the country and so forth. There's a lot that can be done to make us a lot safer. At this particular moment, we actually could end up seeing a nuclear detonation in one of our cities. I don't think we would see an all-out nuclear war any time soon, although even that is not completely off the table. There's still enough nuclear weapons in the arsenals of the superpowers to destroy the Earth many, many times over. There are flash points in India and Pakistan, in the Middle East, in North Korea, other places where the use of nuclear weapons, while initially locally, could very rapidly go into a situation where we'd be facing all-out nuclear war. It's very unsettling.Here we go. OK. I'm back in my truck, and we drove over the Brooklyn Bridge. We're coming down, and we bring that truck that you just saw somewhere in here, in the Financial District. This is a 10-kiloton bomb, slightly smaller than was used in Hiroshima. And I want to just conclude this by just giving you some information. I think â ""news you could use"" kind of concept here. So, first of all, this would be horrific beyond anything we can possibly imagine. This is the ultimate. And if you're in the half-mile radius of where this bomb went off, you have a 90 percent chance of not making it. If you're right where the bomb went off, you will be vaporized. And that's â I'm just telling you, this is not good.(Laughter)You assume that. Two-mile radius, you have a 50 percent chance of being killed, and up to about eight miles away â now I'm talking about killed instantly â somewhere between a 10 and 20 percent chance of getting killed. The thing about this is that the experience of the nuclear detonation is â first of all, tens of millions of degrees Fahrenheit at the core here, where it goes off, and an extraordinary amount of energy in the form of heat, acute radiation and blast effects. An enormous hurricane-like wind, and destruction of buildings almost totally, within this yellow circle here. And what I'm going to focus on, as I come to conclusion here, is that, what happens to you if you're in here? Well, if we're talking about the old days of an all-out nuclear attack, you, up here, are as dead as the people here. So it was a moot point. My point now, though, is that there is a lot that we could do for you who are in here, if you've survived the initial blast. You have, when the blast goes off â and by the way, if it ever comes up, don't look at it.(Laughter)If you look at it, you're going to be blind, either temporarily or permanently. So if there's any way that you can avoid, like, avert your eyes, that would be a good thing. If you find yourself alive, but you're in the vicinity of a nuclear weapon, you have â that's gone off â you have 10 to 20 minutes, depending on the size and exactly where it went off, to get out of the way before a lethal amount of radiation comes straight down from the mushroom cloud that goes up. In that 10 to 15 minutes, all you have to do â and I mean this seriously â is go about a mile away from the blast. And what happens is â this is â I'm going to show you now some fallout plumes. Within 20 minutes, it comes straight down. Within 24 hours, lethal radiation is going out with prevailing winds, and it's mostly in this particular direction â it's going northeast.And if you're in this vicinity, you've got to get away. So you're feeling the wind â and there's tremendous wind now that you're going to be feeling â and you want to go perpendicular to the wind [not upwind or downwind]. if you are in fact able to see where the blast was in front of you. You've got to get out of there. If you don't get out of there, you're going to be exposed to lethal radiation in very short order. If you can't get out of there, we want you to go into a shelter and stay there. Now, in a shelter in an urban area means you have to be either in a basement as deep as possible, or you have to be on a floor â on a high floor â if it's a ground burst explosion, which it would be, higher than the ninth floor. So you have to be tenth floor or higher, or in the basement. But basically, you've got to get out of town as quickly as possible. And if you do that, you actually can survive a nuclear blast.Over the next few days to a week, there will be a radiation cloud, again, going with the wind, and settling down for another 15 or 20 miles out â in this case, over Long Island. And if you're in the direct fallout zone here, you really have to either be sheltered or you have to get out of there, and that's clear. But if you are sheltered, you can actually survive. The difference between knowing information of what you're going to do personally, and not knowing information, can save your life, and it could mean the difference between 150,000 to 200,000 fatalities from something like this and half a million to 700,000 fatalities.So, response planning in the twenty-first century is both possible and is essential. But in 2008, there isn't one single American city that has done effective plans to deal with a nuclear detonation disaster. Part of the problem is that the emergency planners themselves, personally, are overwhelmed psychologically by the thought of nuclear catastrophe. They are paralyzed. You say ""nuclear"" to them, and they're thinking, ""Oh my God, we're all gone. What's the point? It's futile."" And we're trying to tell them, ""It's not futile. We can change the survival rates by doing some commonsensical things.""So the goal here is to minimize fatalities. And I just want to leave you with the personal points that I think you might be interested in. The key to surviving a nuclear blast is getting out, and not going into harm's way. That's basically all we're going to be talking about here. And the farther you are away in distance, the longer it is in time from the initial blast; and the more separation between you and the outside atmosphere, the better. So separation â hopefully with dirt or concrete, or being in a basement â distance and time is what will save you.So here's what you do. First of all, as I said, don't stare at the light flash, if you can. I don't know you could possibly resist doing that. But let's assume, theoretically, you want to do that. You want to keep your mouth open, so your eardrums don't burst from the pressures. If you're very close to what happened, you actually do have to duck and cover, like Bert told you, Bert the Turtle. And you want to get under something so that you're not injured or killed by objects, if that's at all possible. You want to get away from the initial fallout mushroom cloud, I said, in just a few minutes. And shelter and place. You want to move [only] crosswind for 1.2 miles.You know, if you're out there and you see buildings horribly destroyed and down in that direction, less destroyed here, then you know that it was over there, the blast, and you're going this way, as long as you're going crosswise to the wind. Once you're out and evacuating, you want to keep as much of your skin, your mouth and nose covered, as long as that covering doesn't impede you moving and getting out of there. And finally, you want to get decontaminated as soon as possible. And if you're wearing clothing, you've taken off your clothing, you're going to get showered down some place and remove the radiation that would be â the radioactive material that might be on you. And then you want to stay in shelter for 48 to 72 hours minimum, but you're going to wait hopefully â you'll have your little wind-up, battery-less radio, and you'll be waiting for people to tell you when it's safe to go outside. That's what you need to do.In conclusion, nuclear war is less likely than before, but by no means out of the question, and it's not survivable. Nuclear terrorism is possible â it may be probable â but is survivable. And this is Jack Geiger, who's one of the heroes of the U.S. public health community. And Jack said the only way to deal with nuclear anything, whether it's war or terrorism, is abolition of nuclear weapons. And you want something to work on once you've fixed global warming, I urge you to think about the fact that we have to do something about this unacceptable, inhumane reality of nuclear weapons in our world.Now, this is my favorite civil defense slide, and I â (Laughter) â I don't want to be indelicate, but this â he's no longer in office. We don't really care, OK. This was sent to me by somebody who is an aficionado of civil defense procedures, but the fact of the matter is that America's gone through a very hard time. We've not been focused, we've not done what we had to do, and now we're facing the potential of bad, hell on Earth. Thank you.","Sydney. I had been waiting my whole life to get to Sydney. I got to the airport, to the hotel, checked in, and, sitting there in the lobby, was a brochure for the Sydney Festival. I thumbed through it, and I came across a show called ""Minto: Live."" The description read: ""The suburban streets of Minto become the stage for performances created by international artists in collaboration with the people of Minto.""What was this place called Minto? Sydney, as I would learn, is a city of suburbs, and Minto lies southwest, about an hour away. I have to say, it wasn't exactly what I had in mind for my first day down under. I mean, I'd thought about the Harbour Bridge or Bondi Beach, but Minto? But still, I'm a producer, and the lure of a site-specific theater project was more than I could resist. (Laughter)So, off I went into Friday afternoon traffic, and I'll never forget what I saw when I got there. For the performance, the audience walked around the neighborhood from house to house, and the residents, who were the performers, they came out of their houses, and they performed these autobiographical dances on their lawns, on their driveways. (Laughter) The show is a collaboration with a U.K.-based performance company called Lone Twin. Lone Twin had come to Minto and worked with the residents, and they had created these dances.This Australian-Indian girl, she came out and started to dance on her front lawn, and her father peered out the window to see what all the noise and commotion was about, and he soon joined her. And he was followed by her little sister. And soon they were all dancing this joyous, exuberant dance right there on their lawn. (Laughter)And as I walked through the neighborhood, I was amazed and I was moved by the incredible sense of ownership this community clearly felt about this event. ""Minto: Live"" brought Sydneysiders into dialogue with international artists, and really celebrated the diversity of Sydney on its own terms.The Sydney Festival which produced ""Minto: Live"" I think represents a new kind of 21st-century arts festival. These festivals are radically open. They can transform cities and communities.To understand this, I think it kind of makes sense to look where we've come from. Modern arts festivals were born in the rubble of World War II. Civic leaders created these annual events to celebrate culture as the highest expression of the human spirit. In 1947, the Edinburgh Festival was born and Avignon was born and hundreds of others would follow in their wake. The work they did was very, very high art, and stars came along like Laurie Anderson and Merce Cunningham and Robert Lepage who made work for this circuit, and you had these seminal shows like ""The Mahabharata"" and the monumental ""Einstein on the Beach.""But as the decades passed, these festivals, they really became the establishment, and as the culture and capital accelerated, the Internet brought us all together, high and low kind of disappeared, a new kind of festival emerged.The old festivals, they continued to thrive, but from Brighton to Rio to Perth, something new was emerging, and these festivals were really different. They're open, these festivals, because, like in Minto, they understand that the dialogue between the local and the global is essential. They're open because they ask the audience to be a player, a protagonist, a partner, rather than a passive spectator, and they're open because they know that imagination cannot be contained in buildings, and so much of the work they do is site-specific or outdoor work.So, the new festival, it asks the audience to play an essential role in shaping the performance. Companies like De La Guarda, which I produce, and Punchdrunk create these completely immersive experiences that put the audience at the center of the action, but the German performance company Rimini Protokoll takes this all to a whole new level. In a series of shows that includes ""100 Percent Vancouver,"" ""100 Percent Berlin,"" Rimini Protokoll makes shows that actually reflect society. Rimini Protokoll chooses 100 people that represent that city at that moment in terms of race and gender and class, through a careful process that begins three months before, and then those 100 people share stories about themselves and their lives, and the whole thing becomes a snapshot of that city at that moment. LIFT has always been a pioneer in the use of venues. They understand that theater and performance can happen anywhere. You can do a show in a schoolroom, in an airport, â (Laughter) â in a department store window.Artists are explorers. Who better to show us the city anew? Artists can take us to a far-flung part of the city that we haven't explored, or they can take us into that building that we pass every day but we never went into.An artist, I think, can really show us people that we might overlook in our lives. Back to Back is an Australian company of people with intellectual disabilities. I saw their amazing show in New York at the Staten Island Ferry Terminal at rush hour. We, the audience, were given headsets and seated on one side of the terminal. The actors were right there in front of us, right there among the commuters, and we could hear them, but we might not have otherwise seen them. So Back to Back takes site-specific theater and uses it to gently remind us about who and what we choose to edit out of our daily lives.So, the dialogue with the local and the global, the audience as participant and player and protagonist, the innovative use of site, all of these things come to play in the amazing work of the fantastic French company Royal de Luxe. Royal de Luxe's giant puppets come into a city and they live there for a few days.For ""The Sultan's Elephant,"" Royal de Luxe came to central London and brought it to a standstill with their story of a giant little girl and her friend, a time-traveling elephant. For a few days, they transformed a massive city into a community where endless possibility reigned. The Guardian wrote, ""If art is about transformation, then there can be no more transformative experience. What 'The Sultan's Elephant' represents is no less than an artistic occupation of the city and a reclamation of the streets for the people.""We can talk about the economic impacts of these festivals on their cities, but I'm much [more] interested in many more things, like how a festival helps a city to express itself, how it lets it come into its own. Festivals promote diversity, they bring neighbors into dialogue, they increase creativity, they offer opportunities for civic pride, they improve our general psychological well-being. In short, they make cities better places to live.Case in point: When ""The Sultan's Elephant"" came to London just nine months after 7/7, a Londoner wrote, ""For the first time since the London bombings, my daughter called up with that sparkle back in her voice. She had gathered with others to watch 'The Sultan's Elephant,' and, you know, it just made all the difference."" Lyn Gardner in The Guardian has written that a great festival can show us a map of the world, a map of the city and a map of ourselves, but there is no one fixed festival model. I think what's so brilliant about the festivals, the new festivals, is that they are really fully capturing the complexity and the excitement of the way we all live today. Thank you very much. (Applause)","""When the crisis came, the serious limitations of existing economic and financial models immediately became apparent."" ""There is also a strong belief, which I share, that bad or oversimplistic and overconfident economics helped create the crisis.""Now, you've probably all heard of similar criticism coming from people who are skeptical of capitalism. But this is different. This is coming from the heart of finance. The first quote is from Jean-Claude Trichet when he was governor of the European Central Bank. The second quote is from the head of the UK Financial Services Authority. Are these people implying that we don't understand the economic systems that drive our modern societies? It gets worse. ""We spend billions of dollars trying to understand the origins of the universe, while we still don't understand the conditions for a stable society, a functioning economy, or peace.""What's happening here? How can this be possible? Do we really understand more about the fabric of reality than we do about the fabric which emerges from our human interactions? Unfortunately, the answer is yes. But there's an intriguing solution which is coming from what is known as the science of complexity.To explain what this means and what this thing is, please let me quickly take a couple of steps back. I ended up in physics by accident. It was a random encounter when I was young, and since then, I've often wondered about the amazing success of physics in describing the reality we wake up in every day. In a nutshell, you can think of physics as follows. So you take a chunk of reality you want to understand and you translate it into mathematics. You encode it into equations. Then, predictions can be made and tested. We're actually really lucky that this works, because no one really knows why the thoughts in our heads should actually relate to the fundamental workings of the universe. Despite the success, physics has its limits. As Dirk Helbing pointed out in the last quote, we don't really understand the complexity that relates to us, that surrounds us. This paradox is what got me interested in complex systems. So these are systems which are made up of many interconnected or interacting parts: swarms of birds or fish, ant colonies, ecosystems, brains, financial markets. These are just a few examples.Interestingly, complex systems are very hard to map into mathematical equations, so the usual physics approach doesn't really work here. So what do we know about complex systems? Well, it turns out that what looks like complex behavior from the outside is actually the result of a few simple rules of interaction. This means you can forget about the equations and just start to understand the system by looking at the interactions, so you can actually forget about the equations and you just start to look at the interactions. And it gets even better, because most complex systems have this amazing property called emergence. So this means that the system as a whole suddenly starts to show a behavior which cannot be understood or predicted by looking at the components of the system. So the whole is literally more than the sum of its parts. And all of this also means that you can forget about the individual parts of the system, how complex they are. So if it's a cell or a termite or a bird, you just focus on the rules of interaction.As a result, networks are ideal representations of complex systems. The nodes in the network are the system's components, and the links are given by the interactions. So what equations are for physics, complex networks are for the study of complex systems.This approach has been very successfully applied to many complex systems in physics, biology, computer science, the social sciences, but what about economics? Where are economic networks? This is a surprising and prominent gap in the literature. The study we published last year, called ""The Network of Global Corporate Control,"" was the first extensive analysis of economic networks. The study went viral on the Internet and it attracted a lot of attention from the international media. This is quite remarkable, because, again, why did no one look at this before? Similar data has been around for quite some time.What we looked at in detail was ownership networks. So here the nodes are companies, people, governments, foundations, etc. And the links represent the shareholding relations, so shareholder A has x percent of the shares in company B. And we also assign a value to the company given by the operating revenue. So ownership networks reveal the patterns of shareholding relations. In this little example, you can see a few financial institutions with some of the many links highlighted.Now, you may think that no one looked at this before because ownership networks are really, really boring to study. Well, as ownership is related to control, as I shall explain later, looking at ownership networks actually can give you answers to questions like, who are the key players? How are they organized? Are they isolated? Are they interconnected? And what is the overall distribution of control? In other words, who controls the world? I think this is an interesting question.And it has implications for systemic risk. This is a measure of how vulnerable a system is overall. A high degree of interconnectivity can be bad for stability, because then the stress can spread through the system like an epidemic.Scientists have sometimes criticized economists who believe ideas and concepts are more important than empirical data, because a foundational guideline in science is: Let the data speak. OK. Let's do that.So we started with a database containing 13 million ownership relations from 2007. This is a lot of data, and because we wanted to find out ""who rules the world,"" we decided to focus on transnational corporations, or ""TNCs,"" for short. These are companies that operate in more than one country, and we found 43,000. In the next step, we built the network around these companies, so we took all the TNCs' shareholders, and the shareholders' shareholders, etc., all the way upstream, and we did the same downstream, and ended up with a network containing 600,000 nodes and one million links. This is the TNC network which we analyzed.And it turns out to be structured as follows. So you have a periphery and a center which contains about 75 percent of all the players, and in the center, there's this tiny but dominant core which is made up of highly interconnected companies. To give you a better picture, think about a metropolitan area. So you have the suburbs and the periphery, you have a center, like a financial district, then the core will be something like the tallest high-rise building in the center. And we already see signs of organization going on here. 36 percent of the TNCs are in the core only, but they make up 95 percent of the total operating revenue of all TNCs.OK, so now we analyzed the structure, so how does this relate to the control? Well, ownership gives voting rights to shareholders. This is the normal notion of control. And there are different models which allow you to compute the control you get from ownership. If you have more than 50 percent of the shares in a company, you get control, but usually, it depends on the relative distribution of shares. And the network really matters. About 10 years ago, Mr. Tronchetti Provera had ownership and control in a small company, which had ownership and control in a bigger company. You get the idea. This ended up giving him control in Telecom Italia with a leverage of 26. So this means that, with each euro he invested, he was able to move 26 euros of market value through the chain of ownership relations.Now what we actually computed in our study was the control over the TNCs' value. This allowed us to assign a degree of influence to each shareholder. This is very much in the sense of Max Weber's idea of potential power, which is the probability of imposing one's own will despite the opposition of others.If you want to compute the flow in an ownership network, this is what you have to do. It's actually not that hard to understand. Let me explain by giving you this analogy. So think about water flowing in pipes, where the pipes have different thickness. So similarly, the control is flowing in the ownership networks and is accumulating at the nodes. So what did we find after computing all this network control? Well, it turns out that the 737 top shareholders have the potential to collectively control 80 percent of the TNCs' value. Now remember, we started out with 600,000 nodes, so these 737 top players make up a bit more than 0.1 percent. They're mostly financial institutions in the US and the UK. And it gets even more extreme. There are 146 top players in the core, and they together have the potential to collectively control 40 percent of the TNCs' value.What should you take home from all of this? Well, the high degree of control you saw is very extreme by any standard. The high degree of interconnectivity of the top players in the core could pose a significant systemic risk to the global economy. And we could easily reproduce the TNC network with a few simple rules. This means that its structure is probably the result of self-organization. It's an emergent property which depends on the rules of interaction in the system, so it's probably not the result of a top-down approach like a global conspiracy.Our study ""is an impression of the moon's surface. It's not a street map."" So you should take the exact numbers in our study with a grain of salt, yet it ""gave us a tantalizing glimpse of a brave new world of finance."" We hope to have opened the door for more such research in this direction, so the remaining unknown terrain will be charted in the future. And this is slowly starting. We're seeing the emergence of long-term and highly-funded programs which aim at understanding our networked world from a complexity point of view. But this journey has only just begun, so we will have to wait before we see the first results.Now there is still a big problem, in my opinion. Ideas relating to finance, economics, politics, society, are very often tainted by people's personal ideologies. I really hope that this complexity perspective allows for some common ground to be found. It would be really great if it has the power to help end the gridlock created by conflicting ideas, which appears to be paralyzing our globalized world. Reality is so complex, we need to move away from dogma. But this is just my own personal ideology.Thank you.(Applause)",string

Had to carefully use a sharp knife to make the jokes in each of about 6-7 inflssnle plug parts! Precision work considering one wrong slip and the entire pool would be useless. The pump would not inflate unless I made the holes. Could have returned and exchanged the pool but more hassle I did not need! However once I was able to inflate it, relatively straight forward and durable from what I can tell so far",string

In many cases it is especially difficult to measure employment and unemployment in agriculture. The timing of a survey can maximize the effects of seasonal unemployment in agriculture. And informal sector employment is difficult to quantify where informal activities are not tracked.

There may be also persons not currently in the labour market who want to work but do not actively ""seek"" work because they view job opportunities as limited, or because they have restricted labour mobility, or face discrimination, or structural, social or cultural barriers. The exclusion of people who want to work but are not seeking work (often called the ""hidden unemployed"" or ""discouraged workers"") is a criterion that will affect the unemployment count of both women and men. 

However, women tend to be excluded from the count for various reasons. Women suffer more from discrimination and from structural, social, and cultural barriers that impede them from seeking work. Also, women are often responsible for the care of children and the elderly and for household affairs. They may not be available for work during the short reference period, as they need to make arrangements before starting work. Further, women are considered to be employed when they are working part-time or in temporary jobs, despite the instability of these jobs or their active search for more secure employment.","Aggregation of urban and rural population may not add up to total population because of different country coverage. There is no consistent and universally accepted standard for distinguishing urban from rural areas, in part because of the wide variety of situations across countries.

Most countries use an urban classification related to the size or characteristics of settlements. Some define urban areas based on the presence of certain infrastructure and services. And other countries designate urban areas based on administrative arrangements. Because of national differences in the characteristics that distinguish urban from rural areas, the distinction between urban and rural population is not amenable to a single definition that would be applicable to all countries.

Estimates of the world's urban population would change significantly if China, India, and a few other populous nations were to change their definition of urban centers. 

Because the estimates of city and metropolitan area are based on national definitions of what constitutes a city or metropolitan area, cross-country comparisons should be made with caution.","Tourism can be either domestic or international. The data refers to international tourism, where the traveler's country of residence differs from the visiting country. International tourism consists of inbound (arrival) and outbound (departures) tourism.

The data are from the World Tourism Organization (WTO), a United Nations agency. The data on inbound and outbound tourists refer to the number of arrivals and departures, not to the number of people traveling. Thus a person who makes several trips to a country during a given period is counted each time as a new arrival. The data on inbound tourism show the arrivals of nonresident tourists (overnight visitors) at national borders. When data on international tourists are unavailable or incomplete, the data show the arrivals of international visitors, which include tourists, same-day visitors, cruise passengers, and crew members.

Sources and collection methods for arrivals differ across countries. In some cases data are from border statistics (police, immigration, and the like) and supplemented by border surveys. In other cases data are from tourism accommodation establishments. For some countries number of arrivals is limited to arrivals by air and for others to arrivals staying in hotels. Some countries include arrivals of nationals residing abroad while others do not. Caution should thus be used in comparing arrivals across countries.

Expenditure associated with the activity of international visitors has been traditionally identified with the travel item of the Balance of Payments (BOP): in the case of inbound tourism, those expenditures associated with inbound visitors are registered as ""credits"" in the BOP and refers to ""travel receipts"".

The 2008 International Recommendations for Tourism Statistics consider that ""tourism industries and products"" includes transport of passengers. Consequently, a better estimate of tourism-related expenditure by inbound and outbound visitors in an international scenario would be, in terms of the BOP, the value of the travel item plus that of the passenger transport item.

Nevertheless, users should be aware that BOP estimates include, in addition to expenditures associated to visitors, those related to other types of travelers (these might be substantial in some countries; for instance, long-term students or patients, border and seasonal workers, etc.). Also data on expenditure by main purpose of the trip are BOP data.",NANVAL!,"The U.S. Department of Energy's Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) calculates annual anthropogenic emissions from data on fossil fuel consumption (from the United Nations Statistics Division's World Energy Data Set) and world cement manufacturing (from the U.S. Department of Interior's Geological Survey, USGS 2011). Although estimates of global carbon dioxide emissions are probably accurate within 10 percent (as calculated from global average fuel chemistry and use), country estimates may have larger error bounds. Trends estimated from a consistent time series tend to be more accurate than individual values.

Each year the CDIAC recalculates the entire time series since 1949, incorporating recent findings and corrections. Estimates exclude fuels supplied to ships and aircraft in international transport because of the difficulty of apportioning the fuels among benefiting countries.",string

Survey sources include Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Living Standards Measurement Surveys (LSMS), Multi-Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), the World Health Survey (WHS), other nationally developed and implemented surveys, and various government agencies (for example, ministries of energy and utilities). Given the low frequency and the regional distribution of some surveys, a number of countries have gaps in available data. To develop the historical evolution and starting point of electrification rates, a simple modeling approach was adopted to fill in the missing data points - around 1990, around 2000, and around 2010. Therefore, a country can have a continuum of zero to three data points. There are 42 countries with zero data point and the weighted regional average was used as an estimate for electrification in each of the data periods. 170 countries have between one and three data points and missing data are estimated by using a model with region, country, and time variables. The model keeps the original observation if data is available for any of the time periods. This modeling approach allowed the estimation of electrification rates for 212 countries over these three time periods (Indicated as ""Estimate"").

The time and cost necessary to complete every official procedure for exporting and importing the goods are recorded; however, the time and cost for sea transport are not included. All documents needed by the trader to export or import the goods across the border are also recorded. For exporting goods, procedures range from packing the goods into the container at the warehouse to their departure from the port of exit. For importing goods, procedures range from the vessel's arrival at the port of entry to the cargo's delivery at the warehouse. For landlocked economies, these include procedures at the inland border post, since the port is located in the transit economy. Payment is made by letter of credit, and the time, cost and documents required for the issuance or advising of a letter of credit are taken into account. The ranking on the ease of trading across borders is the simple average of the percentile rankings on its component indicators.

Local freight forwarders, shipping lines, customs brokers, port officials and banks provide information on required documents and cost as well as the time to complete each procedure. To make the data comparable across economies, several assumptions about the business and the traded goods are used.

Cost measures the fees levied on a 20-foot container in U.S. dollars. All the fees associated with completing the procedures to export or import the goods are taken into account. These include costs for documents, administrative fees for customs clearance and inspections, customs broker fees, port-related charges and inland transport costs. The cost does not include customs tariffs and duties or costs related to sea transport. Only official costs are recorded.","Pupil-teacher ratio is calculated by dividing the number of students at the specified level of education by the number of teachers at the same level of education.

This time I want to dig deeper into the practicalities of reviewing code, and mention a few things to watch out for. Code review is the first line of defence against hackers and bugs. When you approve a pull request, you're putting your name to it - taking a share of responsibility for the change. Once bad code has got into a system, it can be difficult to remove. Trying to find problems in an existing codebase is like looking for an unknown number of needles in a haystack , but when you're reviewing a pull request it's more like looking in a handful of hay. The difficult part is recognising a needle when you see one. Hopefully this article will help you with that. Code review shouldn't be a box-ticking exercise, but it can be helpful to have a list of common issues to watch out for. As well as the important question of whether the change will actually work, the main areas to consider are: I'll touch on these areas in more detail - I'll be talking about Drupal and PHP in particular, but a lot of the points I'll make are relevant to other languages and frameworks. Security I don't claim to be an expert on security, and often count myself lucky that I work in what my colleague Andrew Harmel-Law calls ""a creative-inventive market, not a safety-critical one"" . Having said that, there are a few common things to keep an eye out for, and developers should be aware of the OWASP top ten list of vulnerabilities . When working with Drupal, you should bear in mind the Drupal security team's advice for writing secure code . For me, the most important points to consider are: Does the code accept user input without proper sanitisation? In short - don't trust user input. The big attack vectors like XSS and SQL injection are based on malicious text strings. Drupal provides several types of text filtering - the appropriate filter depends on what you're going to do with the data, but you should always run user input through some kind of sanitisation . Are we storing sensitive data anywhere we shouldn't be? Security isn't just about stopping bad guys getting in where they shouldn't. Think about what kind of data you have, and what you're doing with it. Make sure that you're not logging people's private data inappropriately, or passing it across network in a way you shouldn't. Even if the site you're working on doesn't have anything as sensitive as the Panama papers , you have a legal, professional, and personal responsibility to make sure that you're handling data properly. Performance When we're considering code changes, we should always think about what impact they will have on the end user, not least in terms of how quickly a site will load. As Google recently reminded us , page load speed is vital for user engagement. Slow, bloated websites cost money, both in terms of mobile data charges and lost revenue . Does the change break caching? Most Drupal performance strategies will talk about the value of caching. The aim of the game is to reduce the amount of work that your web server does. Ideally, the web server won't do any work for a page request from an anonymous user - the whole thing will be handled by a reverse proxy cache, such as Varnish. If the request needs to go to the web server, we want as much of the page as possible to be served from an object cache such as Redis or Memcached, to minimise the number of database queries needed to render the page. Are there any unnecessary uses of $_SESSION ? Typically, reverse proxy servers like Varnish will not cache pages for authenticated users. If the browser has a session, the request won't be served by Varnish, but by the web server. Here's an illustration of why this is so important. This graph shows the difference in response time on a load test environment following a deployment that included some code to create sessions. There were some other changes that impacted performance, but this was the big one. As you can see, overall response time increased six-fold, with the biggest increase in the time spent by the web server processing PHP (the blue sections on the graphs), mainly because a few lines of code creating sessions had slipped through the net. Are there any inefficient loops? The developers' maxims ""Don't Repeat Yourself"" and ""Keep It Simple Stupid"" apply to servers as well. If the server is doing work to render a page, we don't want that work to be repeated or overly complex. What's the front end performance impact? There's no substitute for actually testing, but there are a few things that you can keep an eye out for when reviewing change. Does the change introduce any additional HTTP requests? Perhaps they could be avoided by using sprites or icon fonts. Have any images been optimised? Are you making any repeated DOM queries ? Accessibility Even if you're not an expert on accessibility, and don't know ARIA roles , you can at least bear in mind a few general pointers. When it comes to testing, there's a good checklist from the Accessibility Project , but here are some things I always try to think about when reviewing a pull request. Will it work on a keyboard / screen reader / other input or output device ? Doing proper accessibility testing is difficult, and you may not have access to assistive technology, but a good rule of thumb is that if you can navigate using only a keyboard, it will probably work for someone using one of the myriad input devices . Testing is the only way to be certain, but here are a couple of simple things to remember when reviewing CSS changes: hover and focus should usually go together, and you should almost never use outline: none; . Are you hiding content appropriately? One piece of low-hanging fruit is to make sure that text is available to screen readers and other assistive technology. Any time I see display: none; in a pull request, alarm bells start ringing. It's usually not the right way to hide content . Maintainability Hopefully the system you're working on will last for a long time. People will have to work on it in the future. You should try to make life easier for those people, not least because you'll probably be one of them. Reinventing the wheel Are you writing more code than you need to? It may well be that the problem you're looking at has already been solved, and one of the great things about open source is that you're able to recruit an army of developers and testers you may never meet . Is there already a module for that? On the other hand, even if there is an existing module, it might not always make sense to use it. Perhaps the contributed module provides more flexibility than our project will ever need, at a performance cost. Maybe it gives us 90% of what we want, but would force us to do things in a certain way that would make it difficult to get the final 10%. Perhaps it isn't in a very healthy state - if so, perhaps you could fix it up and contribute your fixes back to the community, as I did on a recent project . If you're writing a custom module to solve a very specific problem, could it be made more generic and contributed to the community? A couple of examples of this from the Capgemini team are Stomp and Route . One of the jobs of the code reviewer is to help draw the appropriate line between the generic and the specific. If you're reviewing custom code, think about whether there's prior art. If the pull request includes community-contributed code, you should still review it. Don't assume that it's perfect, just because someone's given it away for nothing. Appropriate API usage Is your team using your chosen frameworks as they were intended? If you see someone writing a custom function to solve a problem that's already been solved, maybe you need to share a link to the API docs for the existing solution. Introducing notices and errors If your logs are littered with notices about undefined variables or array indexes, not only are you likely to be suffering a performance hit from the logging, but it's much harder to separate the signal from the noise when you're trying to investigate something. Browser support Remember that sometimes, it's good to be boring . As a reviewer, one of your jobs is to stop your colleagues from getting carried away with shiny new features like ES6, or CSS variables. Tools like Can I Use are really useful in being able to check what's going to work in the browsers that you care about. Code smells Sometimes, code seems wrong. As I learned from Larry Garfield's excellent presentation on code smells at the first Drupalcon I went to, code smells are indications of things that might be a deeper problem. Rather than re-hash the points Larry made, I'd recommend reading his slides , but it is worth highlighting some of the anti-patterns he discusses. Functions or objects that do more than one thing A function should have a function. Not two functions, or three. If an appropriate comment or function name includes ""and"", it's a sign you should be splitting the function up. Functions that sometimes do different things Another bad sign is the word ""or"" in the comment. Functions should always do the same thing. Excessive complexity Long functions are usually a sign that you might want to think about refactoring. They tend to be an indicator that the code is more complex than it needs to be. The level of complexity can be measured , but you don't need a tool to tell you that if a function doesn't fit on a screen, it'll be difficult to debug. Not being testable Even if functions are simple enough to write tests for, do they depend on a whole system? In other words, can they be genuinely unit tested? Lack of documentation There's more to be said on the subject of code comments than I can go into here, but suffice to say code should have useful, meaningful comments to help future maintainers understand it. Tight coupling Modules should be modular. If two parts of a system need to interact, they should have a clearly defined and documented interface. Impurity Side effects and global variables should generally be avoided. Sensible naming Is the purpose of a function or variable obvious from the name? I don't want to rehash old jokes , but naming things is difficult, and it is important. Why would you comment out lines of code? If you don't need it, delete it. The beauty of version control is that you can go back in time to see what code used to be there. As long as you write a good commit message, it'll be easy enough to find. If you think that you might need it later, put it behind a feature toggle so that the functionality can be enabled without a code release. Specificity In CSS, IDs and !important are the big code smells for me. They're a bad sign that a specificity arms race has begun. Even if you aren't going to go all the way with a system like BEM or SMACSS , it's a good idea to keep specificity as low as possible. The excellent articles on CSS specificity by Harry Roberts and Chris Coyier are good starting points for learning more. Standards It's important to follow coding standards . The point of this isn't to get some imaginary Scout badge - code that follows standards is easier to read, which makes it easier to understand, and by extension easier to maintain. In addition, if you have your IDE set up right, it can warn you of possible problems, but those warnings will only be manageable if you keep your code clean . Deployability Will your changes be available in environments built by Continuous Integration? Do you need to set default values of variables which may need overriding for different environments? Just as your functions should be testable, so should your configuration changes. As far as possible, aim to make everything repeatable and automatable - if a release needs any manual changes it's a sign that your team may need to be thinking with more of a DevOps mindset . Keep Your Eyes On The Prize With all this talk of coding style and standards, don't get distracted by trivialities - it is worth caring about things like whitespace and variable naming, but remember that it's much more important to think about whether the code actually does what it is supposed to . The trouble is that our eyes tend to fixate on those sort of things, and they cause unnecessary cognitive load . Pre-commit hooks can help to catch coding standards violations so that reviewers don't need to waste their time commenting on them. If you're on a big project, it will almost certainly be worth investing some time in integrating your CI server and your code review tool, and automating checks for issues like code style , unit tests, mess detection - in short, all the things that a computer is better at spotting than humans are. Does the code actually solve the problem you want it to? Rather than just looking at the code, spend a couple of minutes reading the ticket that it is associated with - has the developer understood the requirements properly? Have they approached the issue appropriately? If you're not sure about the change, check out the branch locally and test it in your development environment. Even if there's nothing wrong with the suggested change, maybe there's a better way of doing it. The whole point of code review is to share the benefit of the team's various experiences, get extra eyes on the problem, and hopefully make the end product better. I hope that this has been useful for you, and if there's anything you think I've missed, please let me know via the comments.","The final part of the study guide is below - thanks to all those who have tuned in over the past few weeks and given some very positive feedback. I hope it helps (or has helped) you get into the Solutions Architect Pro club. It's a tough exam to pass and the feeling of achievement is immense. Good luck! 8.1 Plan and execute for applications migrations AWS Management Portal available to plug AWS infrastructure into vCenter. This uses a virtual appliance and can enable migration of vSphere workloads into AWS Right click on VM and select ""Migrate to EC2"" You then select region, environment, subnet, instance type, security group, private IP address Use cases:- Migrate VMs to EC2 (VM must be powered off and configured for DHCP) Reach new regions from vCenter to use for DR etc Self service AWS portal in vCenter Create new EC2 instances using VM templates Templates map to AMIs and can be used to let admins pick a type for their deployment Storage Gateway can be used as a migration tool Gateway cached volumes (block based iSCSI) Gateway stored volumes (block based iSCSI) Virtual tape library (iSCSI based VTL) Takes snapshots of mounted iSCSI volumes and replicates them via HTTPS to AWS. From here they are stored in S3 as snapshots and then you can mount them as EBS volumes It is recommended to get a consistent snapshot of the VM by powering it off, taking a VM snapshot and then replicating this AWS Data Pipeline is a web service that helps you reliably process and move data between different AWS compute and storage services, as well as on-premise data sources, at specified intervals. With AWS Data Pipeline, you can regularly access your data where it's stored, transform and process it at scale, and efficiently transfer the results to AWS services such as Amazon S3, Amazon RDS, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR). AWS Data Pipeline helps you easily create complex data processing workloads that are fault tolerant, repeatable, and highly available. You don't have to worry about ensuring resource availability, managing inter-task dependencies, retrying transient failures or timeouts in individual tasks, or creating a failure notification system. AWS Data Pipeline also allows you to move and process data that was previously locked up in on-premise data silos Pipeline has the following concepts:- Pipeline (container node that is made up of the items below, can run on either EC2 instance or EMR node which are provisioned automatically by DP) Datanode (end point destination, such as S3 bucket) Activity (job kicked off by DP, such as database dump, command line script) Precondition (readiness check optionally associated with data source or activity. Activity will not be done if check fails. Standard and custom preconditions available- DynamoDBTableExists, DynamoDBDataExists, S3KeyExists, S3PrefixExists, ShellCommandPrecondition) Pipelines can also be used with on premises resources such as databases etc Task Runner package is installed on the on premises resource to poll the Data Pipeline queue for work to do (database dump etc, copy to S3) Much of the functionality has been replaced by Lambda Setup logging to S3 so you can troubleshoot it 8.2 Demonstrate ability to design hybrid cloud architectures Biggest CIDR block you can have is a /16 and smallest is /28 for reservations First four IP addresses and last one are reserved by AWS - always 5 reserved 10.0.0.0 - Network address 10.0.0.1 - Reserved for VPC router 10.0.0.2 - Reserved by AWS for DNS services 10.0.0.3 - Reserved by AWS for future use 10.0.0.255 - Reserved for network broadcast. Network broadcast not supported in a VPC, so this is reserved When migrating to Direct Connect from a VPN, make the VPN connection and Direct Connect connection(s) as part of the same BGP area. Then configure the VPN to have a higher cost than the Direct Connect connection. BGP route prepending will do this as BGP is a metric based protocol. A single ASN is considered a more preferable route than an ASN with three or four values For applications that require multicast, you need to configure a VPN between the EC2 instances with in-instance software, so the underlying AWS infrastructure is not aware of it. Multicast is not supported by AWS VPN network must be a different CIDR block than the underlying instances are using (for example 10.x address for EC2 instances and 172.16.x addresses for VPN connection to another VPC) SQL can be migrated by exporting database as flat files from SQL Management Studio, can't replicate to another region or from on premises to AWS CloudSearch can index documents stored in S3 and is powered by Apache SOLR Can also search DynamoDB with CloudSearch CloudSearch can automatically scale based on load or can be manually scaled ahead of expected load increase Multi-AZ is supported and it's basically a service hosted on EC2, and these are how the costs are derived EMR can be used to run batch processing jobs, such as filtering log files and putting results into S3 EMR uses Hadoop which uses HDFS, a distributed file system across all nodes in the cluster where there are multiple copies of the data, meaning resilience of the data and also enables parallel processing across multiple nodes Hive is used to perform SQL like queries on the data in Hadoop, uses simple syntax to process large data sets Pig is used to write MapReduce programs EMR cluster has three components:- Master node (manages data distribution) Core node (stores data on HDFS from tasks run by task nodes and are managed by the master node) Task nodes (managed by the master node and perform processing tasks only, do not form part of HDFS and pass processed data back to core nodes for storage) EMRFS can be used to output data to S3 instead of HDFS Can use spot, on demand or reserved instances for EMR cluster nodes S3DistCp is an extension of DistCp that is optimized to work with AWS, particularly Amazon S3. You use S3DistCp by adding it as a step in a cluster or at the command line. Using S3DistCp, you can efficiently copy large amounts of data from Amazon S3 into HDFS where it can be processed by subsequent steps in your Amazon EMR cluster Larger data files are more efficient than smaller ones in EMR Storing data persistently on S3 may well be cheaper than leveraging HDFS as large data sets will require large instances sizes in the EMR cluster Smaller EMR cluster with larger nodes may be just as efficient but more cost effective Try to complete jobs within 59 minutes to save money (EMR billed by hour)","Apenas 41% dos profissionais de Tecnologia da InformaÃ§Ã£o acreditam que seus departamentos de TI estÃ£o prontos para os negÃ³cios digitais dos prÃ³ximos dois anos, afirma o Gartner. A consultoria consultou 948 clientes em 30 paÃ­ses, entrevistando profissionais de TI de diversas Ã¡reas e disciplinas durante o primeiro trimestre dete ano. Para realizaÃ§Ã£o do estudo, eles foram questionados sobre suas funÃ§Ãµes e sobre como as organizaÃ§Ãµes estÃ£o tentando se transformar para os desafios dos negÃ³cios digitais. A maioria dos profissionais (91%) acredita ter uma funÃ§Ã£o a desempenhar na transformaÃ§Ã£o digital de suas empresas. Entretanto, 59% reconhecem que seus departamentos estÃ£o despreparados para os negÃ³cios digitais dos prÃ³ximos dois anos. ConclusÃµes mais recentes destacam uma preocupaÃ§Ã£o real: o desconforto sobre o quÃ£o bem os setores de TI estÃ£o preparados refletem dÃ©ficits de habilidade em Ã¡reas tecnolÃ³gicas e nÃ£o tecnolÃ³gicas. As Ã¡reas de tecnologia consideradas mais influentes nas atividades e carreiras dos profissionais de TI nos prÃ³ximos 18 meses sÃ£o ComputaÃ§Ã£o em Nuvem, Analytics, Mobilidade e SeguranÃ§a. Dos profissionais de TI entrevistados, 22% identificaram a Nuvem como a tecnologia que terÃ¡ o maior impacto em suas carreiras ao longo deste ano. Dados/Analytics foi considerado o segundo item mais popular, com 11% das escolhas. ""Adquirir rapidamente as habilidades de Nuvem Ã© fundamental para que os profissionais de TI possam repensar e reconstruir a infraestrutura de Tecnologia da InformaÃ§Ã£o de suas empresas para melhor possibilitar as estratÃ©gias de negÃ³cios digitais.

HÃ¡ um conjunto completo de tecnologias e habilidades relacionadas Ã  eficiÃªncia que os profissionais de TI devem planejar para o momento"", explica John Hagerty, Vice-Presidente e Analista EmÃ©rito do Gartner. O estudo pediu aos profissionais de TI que identificassem atÃ© trÃªs lacunas nas habilidades que suas organizaÃ§Ãµes estavam tentando preencher com relaÃ§Ã£o aos negÃ³cios digitais, de informÃ¡tica ou tecnologia. Nuvem e Dados/Analytics lideraram a lista. Os participantes tambÃ©m apontaram lacunas em habilidades tÃ©cnicas gerais (indicando falta de conhecimento tecnolÃ³gico abrangente), bem como nos campos de seguranÃ§a, modernizaÃ§Ã£o de legado, mobilidade e Internet das Coisas. ""Isso, porÃ©m, nÃ£o Ã© somente sobre a tecnologia, pois as principais respostas foram habilidades de eficiÃªncia profissional, pensamento crÃ­tico, raciocÃ­nio e soluÃ§Ã£o de problemas, conhecimento e perspicÃ¡cia de negÃ³cios e habilidades de comunicaÃ§Ã£o"" completa Hagerty. AlÃ©m disso, 29% disseram que o engajamento com as demandas de negÃ³cios digitais deveriam ser seus deveres principais ou uma parte significante de suas atividades. ""Os profissionais de TI indicam que suas prioridades de investimento, alteraÃ§Ãµes de infraestrutura, habilidades de desenvolvimento e interaÃ§Ãµes de negÃ³cios com TI estÃ£o em fluxo e que eles nÃ£o tÃªm certeza de como seus departamentos passarÃ£o pela transformaÃ§Ã£o digital.

Veja outros dados do Gartner (Abra a imagem em outra janela para ampliar)","In March, I did a presentation at SxSW that asked the audience a question I've been thinking about a lot lately: ""Can we save the open web?"". The web is centralizing around a handful of large companies that control what we see, limit creative freedom, and capture a lot of information about us. I worry that we risk losing the serendipity, creativity and decentralization that made the open web great. While there are no easy answers to this question, the presentation started a good discussion about the future of the open web, the role of algorithms in society, and how we might be able to take back control of our personal information. I'm going to use my blog to continue the conversation about the open web, since it impacts the future of Drupal . I'm including the video and slides (PDF, 76 MB) of my SxSW presentation below, as well as an overview of what I discussed. Here are the key ideas I discussed in my presentation, along with a few questions to discuss in the comments. Idea 1: An FDA-like organization to provide oversight for algorithms. While an ""FDA"" in and of itself may not be the most ideal solution, algorithms are nearly everywhere in society and are beginning to impact life-or-death decisions. I gave the example of an algorithm for a self-driving car having to decide whether to save the driver or hit a pedestrian crossing the street. There are many other life-or-death examples of how unregulated technology could impact people in the future, and I believe this is an issue we need to begin thinking about now. What do you suggest we do to make the use of algorithms fair and trustworthy? Idea 2: Open standards that will allow for information-sharing across sites and applications. Closed platforms like Facebook and Google are winning because they're able to deliver a superior user experience driven by massive amounts of data and compute power. For the vast majority of people, ease-of-use will trump most concerns around privacy and control. I believe we need to create a set of open standards that enable drastically better information-sharing and integration between websites and applications so independent websites can offer user experiences that meet or exceeds that of the large platforms. How can the Drupal community help solve this problem? Idea 3: A personal information broker that allows people more control over their data. In the past, I've written about the idea for a personal information broker that will give people control over how, where and for how long their data is used, across every single interaction on the web. This is no small feat. An audience member asked an interesting question about who will build this personal information broker -- whether it will be a private company, a government, an NGO, or a non-profit organization? I'm not really sure I have the answer, but I am optimistic that we can figure that out. I wish I had the resources to build this myself as I believe this will be a critical building block for the web. What do you think is the best way forward? Ultimately, we should be building the web that we want to use, and that we want our children to be using for decades to come. It's time to start to rethink the foundations, before it's too late. If we can move any of these ideas forward in a meaningful way, they will impact billions of people, and billions more in the future.","The Aite Group projects the blockchain market could be valued at $400 million by 2019. For that reason, some of the biggest names in banking, industry and technology have entered into the space to evaluate how this technology could change the financial world. IBM and Linux, for instance, have brought together some of the brightest minds in the industry and technology to work on blockchain technology through the Hyperledger Project. The Hyperledger Project is under the umbrella of the Linux Foundation, and seeks to incorporate findings by blockchain projects such as Blockstream, Ripple, Digital Asset Holdings and others in order to make blockchain technology useful for the world's biggest corporations. IBM has also contributed its own code to the project. According to John Wolpert, IBM's Global Blockchain Offering Director, when IBM and Linux began working together on the blockchain project, Linux made clear it wanted to ""disrupt the disruption,"" in part with their findings, as well as the data gathered by projects such as Ripple, Ethereum and others exploring the blockchain. The Linux foundation announced its Hyperledger project on December 17, 2015. Just one day later, 2,300 companies had requested to join. The second-largest open source foundation in the history of open source had only 450 inquiries. ""So, it's either going to be a holy mess or it's going to change the world,"" Wolpert said at The Blockchain Conference in San Francisco presented by Lighthouse Partners. As Wolford puts it, a team of IBMers is ""on a quest"" to understand and ""do something important"" with blockchain technology. ""I don't know why we got this rap in the '70s, way back, that we are not cool, that we're kind of stodgy, and that is not the IBM of my experience,"" Wolpert, who founded the taxi service Flywheel, explained. ""We're the original crazy people. The craziest people are the guys at IBM in the '60s and '70s -- you can imagine what they were doing in the '60s -- they are wild-eyed revolutionaries."" Although this is not the image IBM markets, their work in quantum computing, quantum teleportation and neuro semantic chips count among some of the ""cool stuff"" IBM does, says Wolpert. IBM also approaches projects in the spirit of open innovation, and not proprietarily. ""Our method of operations is open, and it's often our MO to back not-our-thing,"" he said of IBM since the 1990s. Wolpert cites Java as one such project: ""You would not know about Java today if it weren't for IBM."" As a ""pretty young dude,"" Wolpert was in the room when IBM made a billion-dollar decision to back Linux over its own technology. He also cites IBM's work on XML as an example of IBM's dedication to open innovation. Currently, IBM has employees working on crypto-security and distributed systems who have been working on consensus algorithms for their entire careers, some for more than 30 years. ""They're crazy smart, we're planetary, we've gone from a couple of guys in a canoe, to a platoon and approaching an army of people working on blockchain,"" Wolpert said. ""So it feels a lot like my first job at IBM which was making Java real for business."" This has led old and new friends to contact the the multinational technology and consulting corporation. ""Banks who have been calling us constantly ... saying 'What's your view on blockchain?' or 'Hey, let's do a project together on blockchain,'"" Wolpert said. ""We've been doing all these crazy projects on blockchain, every kind of blockchain, and learning a lot, been doing that for a couple years and really started to accelerate last year."" Today, there is a whole unit dedicated to blockchain technology at Linux Foundation. ""We went all-in on blockchain,"" he explained. What's it all about for Wolpert? ""It's about evolving the Internet."" Bitcoin is important for moving money around without a single authority. ""[Bitcoin] is a solution to a problem, a specific problem, of people who need to move money around in environments where you don't trust the government,"" Wolpert said. ""I think we can all agree we are approaching the end of the era where a single authority manages trust and gets compensated for the risk in doing so."" In Wolpert's view, finance does not need to go from today's system of trust -- where consumers trust institutions to handle their money -- to one of complete trustlessness, like the Bitcoin system in which a protocol, not a centralized authority, manages the movement of value. ""It doesn't follow, having one single trust authority to trustlessness on everything,"" he said. ""There is a false dichotomy between the notion of trust and trustlessness, that you have to have a walled garden on one side and Bitcoin on the other."" He doesn't compare Bitcoin to the Internet, saying that's a wrong analogy. ""It is not apt to say the Internet is like Bitcoin; the Internet is, from the perspective of Bitcoin, a permissioned walled garden,"" he said. ""Ever heard of ICANN? It's permissive, but it's permissioned."" Bitcoin, Ripple and Ethereum are ""Iteration 1"" of blockchain technology, the three time IBMer told his audience. Wolpert thinks blockchain technology will soon evolve to ""Iteration 2."" The problem with it? ""The Internet is constrained,"" Wolpert said. ""You have a fabric that allows for lots of competition on platforms and huge amounts of competition on solutions and applications on top of it, so we need to evolve the Internet to become economically aware, and that Internet isn't going to be an application, it is going to be a fabric and then lots of applications on top of that."" This doesn't mean blockchain 2.0 technologies such as Blockstream, Ethereum and Ripple are lost causes that must now completely retool. The Linux Foundation, in fact, works with Ethereum and Ripple employees. With its blockchain projects, IBM is not focused on moving a cryptocurrency. ""Lots of banks pay us lots of money and we like that, and we want to radically improve them,"" Wolpert explained. ""[Bankers] are gonna try like heck to radically improve what is going on ahead of the disruption, disrupt themselves if you will. If you look at things like [Overstock's] t0, that's happening, might happen on Bitcoin protocol, but might not, and there's plenty of ways to solve it, when you commit to it. And sure, Bitcoin has woken [banks] up to this, so it's doing its job, it's disrupting the thinking and maybe that is all that is necessary."" Wolpert wonders aloud during his speech if the world would have iTunes were it not for Napster, or Netflix if it weren't for BitTorrent. The former head of products for IBM's Watson Ecosystem says IBM currently has a ""boomtown with giant numbers of people at IBM and everywhere else"" investigating the blockchain problem and how distributed technology can be made useful for industry. He details how oftentimes IBM tinkers with open innovations itself to make the technology ready for industry. That's not the route being taken with Bitcoin. That the Bitcoin network is on par with Ireland for energy consumption, and that mining consortiums could eventually dictate that market, scares the firm away from dealing directly with Bitcoin. ""What I want to see, what we want to see, is a world full of companies who I can know, who I can identify, who are so spread out, like the Internet,"" he said. Wolpert cites the Arab Spring, and the role the Internet played in that uprising, as how a permissioned, yet permissive, structure functions. Websites, albeit technology permissioned by ICANN, remained online during the protests and played a major role. What's the risk in experimenting with blockchain? ""The risk is we go crazy, we have an unruly mess,"" Wolpert warned. ""[But] it's the Linux Foundation, we've been in this movie before. While there's a lot of really smart guys working on Bitcoin and startups, we've got equally amount of people who also have 20 or 30 years of experience with open source and open innovation, and I think we have a good shot at maintaining restraints, keeping it scoped down, keeping it simple, but getting it to something that is useful.""",string
