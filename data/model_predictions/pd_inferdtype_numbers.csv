Add addRules, removeRules, and getRules to the definition of Event in extensions.json so that it gets documented naturally. Add links in each method to events.html#declarative (which would go the new section in events.html).4. declarative.html should become very thin, just a few utilities and links in each to events.html#declarative5. declarativeWebRequest.html refers to events.html#declarative and contains doc for its own specific types. declarativeWebRequest.html should have a warning at the top that it is dev-channel only.

233,text,Not Numbers,Not Numbers,g,3122,0,0.0,899.4484304932736,1044.7988459538542,True,"In a previous article on this blog, I talked about why code review is a good idea , and some aspects of how to conduct them. This time I want to dig deeper into the practicalities of reviewing code, and mention a few things to watch out for. Code review is the first line of defence against hackers and bugs. When you approve a pull request, you're putting your name to it - taking a share of responsibility for the change. Once bad code has got into a system, it can be difficult to remove. Trying to find problems in an existing codebase is like looking for an unknown number of needles in a haystack , but when you're reviewing a pull request it's more like looking in a handful of hay. The difficult part is recognising a needle when you see one. Hopefully this article will help you with that. Code review shouldn't be a box-ticking exercise, but it can be helpful to have a list of common issues to watch out for. As well as the important question of whether the change will actually work, the main areas to consider are: I'll touch on these areas in more detail - I'll be talking about Drupal and PHP in particular, but a lot of the points I'll make are relevant to other languages and frameworks. Security I don't claim to be an expert on security, and often count myself lucky that I work in what my colleague Andrew Harmel-Law calls ""a creative-inventive market, not a safety-critical one"" . Having said that, there are a few common things to keep an eye out for, and developers should be aware of the OWASP top ten list of vulnerabilities . When working with Drupal, you should bear in mind the Drupal security team's advice for writing secure code . For me, the most important points to consider are: Does the code accept user input without proper sanitisation? In short - don't trust user input. The big attack vectors like XSS and SQL injection are based on malicious text strings. Drupal provides several types of text filtering - the appropriate filter depends on what you're going to do with the data, but you should always run user input through some kind of sanitisation . Are we storing sensitive data anywhere we shouldn't be? Security isn't just about stopping bad guys getting in where they shouldn't. Think about what kind of data you have, and what you're doing with it. Make sure that you're not logging people's private data inappropriately, or passing it across network in a way you shouldn't. Even if the site you're working on doesn't have anything as sensitive as the Panama papers , you have a legal, professional, and personal responsibility to make sure that you're handling data properly. Performance When we're considering code changes, we should always think about what impact they will have on the end user, not least in terms of how quickly a site will load. As Google recently reminded us , page load speed is vital for user engagement. Slow, bloated websites cost money, both in terms of mobile data charges and lost revenue . Does the change break caching? Most Drupal performance strategies will talk about the value of caching. The aim of the game is to reduce the amount of work that your web server does. Ideally, the web server won't do any work for a page request from an anonymous user - the whole thing will be handled by a reverse proxy cache, such as Varnish. If the request needs to go to the web server, we want as much of the page as possible to be served from an object cache such as Redis or Memcached, to minimise the number of database queries needed to render the page. Are there any unnecessary uses of $_SESSION ? Typically, reverse proxy servers like Varnish will not cache pages for authenticated users. If the browser has a session, the request won't be served by Varnish, but by the web server. Here's an illustration of why this is so important. This graph shows the difference in response time on a load test environment following a deployment that included some code to create sessions. There were some other changes that impacted performance, but this was the big one. As you can see, overall response time increased six-fold, with the biggest increase in the time spent by the web server processing PHP (the blue sections on the graphs), mainly because a few lines of code creating sessions had slipped through the net. Are there any inefficient loops? The developers' maxims ""Don't Repeat Yourself"" and ""Keep It Simple Stupid"" apply to servers as well. If the server is doing work to render a page, we don't want that work to be repeated or overly complex. What's the front end performance impact? There's no substitute for actually testing, but there are a few things that you can keep an eye out for when reviewing change. Does the change introduce any additional HTTP requests? Perhaps they could be avoided by using sprites or icon fonts. Have any images been optimised? Are you making any repeated DOM queries ? Accessibility Even if you're not an expert on accessibility, and don't know ARIA roles , you can at least bear in mind a few general pointers. When it comes to testing, there's a good checklist from the Accessibility Project , but here are some things I always try to think about when reviewing a pull request. Will it work on a keyboard / screen reader / other input or output device ? Doing proper accessibility testing is difficult, and you may not have access to assistive technology, but a good rule of thumb is that if you can navigate using only a keyboard, it will probably work for someone using one of the myriad input devices . Testing is the only way to be certain, but here are a couple of simple things to remember when reviewing CSS changes: hover and focus should usually go together, and you should almost never use outline: none; . Are you hiding content appropriately? One piece of low-hanging fruit is to make sure that text is available to screen readers and other assistive technology. Any time I see display: none; in a pull request, alarm bells start ringing. It's usually not the right way to hide content . Maintainability Hopefully the system you're working on will last for a long time. People will have to work on it in the future. You should try to make life easier for those people, not least because you'll probably be one of them. Reinventing the wheel Are you writing more code than you need to? It may well be that the problem you're looking at has already been solved, and one of the great things about open source is that you're able to recruit an army of developers and testers you may never meet . Is there already a module for that? On the other hand, even if there is an existing module, it might not always make sense to use it. Perhaps the contributed module provides more flexibility than our project will ever need, at a performance cost. Maybe it gives us 90% of what we want, but would force us to do things in a certain way that would make it difficult to get the final 10%. Perhaps it isn't in a very healthy state - if so, perhaps you could fix it up and contribute your fixes back to the community, as I did on a recent project . If you're writing a custom module to solve a very specific problem, could it be made more generic and contributed to the community? A couple of examples of this from the Capgemini team are Stomp and Route . One of the jobs of the code reviewer is to help draw the appropriate line between the generic and the specific. If you're reviewing custom code, think about whether there's prior art. If the pull request includes community-contributed code, you should still review it. Don't assume that it's perfect, just because someone's given it away for nothing. Appropriate API usage Is your team using your chosen frameworks as they were intended? If you see someone writing a custom function to solve a problem that's already been solved, maybe you need to share a link to the API docs for the existing solution. Introducing notices and errors If your logs are littered with notices about undefined variables or array indexes, not only are you likely to be suffering a performance hit from the logging, but it's much harder to separate the signal from the noise when you're trying to investigate something. Browser support Remember that sometimes, it's good to be boring . As a reviewer, one of your jobs is to stop your colleagues from getting carried away with shiny new features like ES6, or CSS variables. Tools like Can I Use are really useful in being able to check what's going to work in the browsers that you care about. Code smells Sometimes, code seems wrong. As I learned from Larry Garfield's excellent presentation on code smells at the first Drupalcon I went to, code smells are indications of things that might be a deeper problem. Rather than re-hash the points Larry made, I'd recommend reading his slides , but it is worth highlighting some of the anti-patterns he discusses. Functions or objects that do more than one thing A function should have a function. Not two functions, or three. If an appropriate comment or function name includes ""and"", it's a sign you should be splitting the function up. Functions that sometimes do different things Another bad sign is the word ""or"" in the comment. Functions should always do the same thing. Excessive complexity Long functions are usually a sign that you might want to think about refactoring. They tend to be an indicator that the code is more complex than it needs to be. The level of complexity can be measured , but you don't need a tool to tell you that if a function doesn't fit on a screen, it'll be difficult to debug. Not being testable Even if functions are simple enough to write tests for, do they depend on a whole system? In other words, can they be genuinely unit tested? Lack of documentation There's more to be said on the subject of code comments than I can go into here, but suffice to say code should have useful, meaningful comments to help future maintainers understand it. Tight coupling Modules should be modular. If two parts of a system need to interact, they should have a clearly defined and documented interface. Impurity Side effects and global variables should generally be avoided. Sensible naming Is the purpose of a function or variable obvious from the name? I don't want to rehash old jokes , but naming things is difficult, and it is important. Why would you comment out lines of code? If you don't need it, delete it. The beauty of version control is that you can go back in time to see what code used to be there. As long as you write a good commit message, it'll be easy enough to find. If you think that you might need it later, put it behind a feature toggle so that the functionality can be enabled without a code release. Specificity In CSS, IDs and !important are the big code smells for me. They're a bad sign that a specificity arms race has begun. Even if you aren't going to go all the way with a system like BEM or SMACSS , it's a good idea to keep specificity as low as possible. The excellent articles on CSS specificity by Harry Roberts and Chris Coyier are good starting points for learning more. Standards It's important to follow coding standards . The point of this isn't to get some imaginary Scout badge - code that follows standards is easier to read, which makes it easier to understand, and by extension easier to maintain. In addition, if you have your IDE set up right, it can warn you of possible problems, but those warnings will only be manageable if you keep your code clean . Deployability Will your changes be available in environments built by Continuous Integration? Do you need to set default values of variables which may need overriding for different environments? Just as your functions should be testable, so should your configuration changes. As far as possible, aim to make everything repeatable and automatable - if a release needs any manual changes it's a sign that your team may need to be thinking with more of a DevOps mindset . Keep Your Eyes On The Prize With all this talk of coding style and standards, don't get distracted by trivialities - it is worth caring about things like whitespace and variable naming, but remember that it's much more important to think about whether the code actually does what it is supposed to . The trouble is that our eyes tend to fixate on those sort of things, and they cause unnecessary cognitive load . Pre-commit hooks can help to catch coding standards violations so that reviewers don't need to waste their time commenting on them. If you're on a big project, it will almost certainly be worth investing some time in integrating your CI server and your code review tool, and automating checks for issues like code style , unit tests, mess detection - in short, all the things that a computer is better at spotting than humans are. Does the code actually solve the problem you want it to? Rather than just looking at the code, spend a couple of minutes reading the ticket that it is associated with - has the developer understood the requirements properly? Have they approached the issue appropriately? If you're not sure about the change, check out the branch locally and test it in your development environment. Even if there's nothing wrong with the suggested change, maybe there's a better way of doing it. The whole point of code review is to share the benefit of the team's various experiences, get extra eyes on the problem, and hopefully make the end product better. I hope that this has been useful for you, and if there's anything you think I've missed, please let me know via the comments.","The final part of the study guide is below - thanks to all those who have tuned in over the past few weeks and given some very positive feedback. I hope it helps (or has helped) you get into the Solutions Architect Pro club. It's a tough exam to pass and the feeling of achievement is immense. Good luck! 8.1 Plan and execute for applications migrations AWS Management Portal available to plug AWS infrastructure into vCenter. This uses a virtual appliance and can enable migration of vSphere workloads into AWS Right click on VM and select ""Migrate to EC2"" You then select region, environment, subnet, instance type, security group, private IP address Use cases:- Migrate VMs to EC2 (VM must be powered off and configured for DHCP) Reach new regions from vCenter to use for DR etc Self service AWS portal in vCenter Create new EC2 instances using VM templates Templates map to AMIs and can be used to let admins pick a type for their deployment Storage Gateway can be used as a migration tool Gateway cached volumes (block based iSCSI) Gateway stored volumes (block based iSCSI) Virtual tape library (iSCSI based VTL) Takes snapshots of mounted iSCSI volumes and replicates them via HTTPS to AWS. From here they are stored in S3 as snapshots and then you can mount them as EBS volumes It is recommended to get a consistent snapshot of the VM by powering it off, taking a VM snapshot and then replicating this AWS Data Pipeline is a web service that helps you reliably process and move data between different AWS compute and storage services, as well as on-premise data sources, at specified intervals. With AWS Data Pipeline, you can regularly access your data where it's stored, transform and process it at scale, and efficiently transfer the results to AWS services such as Amazon S3, Amazon RDS, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR). AWS Data Pipeline helps you easily create complex data processing workloads that are fault tolerant, repeatable, and highly available. You don't have to worry about ensuring resource availability, managing inter-task dependencies, retrying transient failures or timeouts in individual tasks, or creating a failure notification system. AWS Data Pipeline also allows you to move and process data that was previously locked up in on-premise data silos Pipeline has the following concepts:- Pipeline (container node that is made up of the items below, can run on either EC2 instance or EMR node which are provisioned automatically by DP) Datanode (end point destination, such as S3 bucket) Activity (job kicked off by DP, such as database dump, command line script) Precondition (readiness check optionally associated with data source or activity. Activity will not be done if check fails. Standard and custom preconditions available- DynamoDBTableExists, DynamoDBDataExists, S3KeyExists, S3PrefixExists, ShellCommandPrecondition) Pipelines can also be used with on premises resources such as databases etc Task Runner package is installed on the on premises resource to poll the Data Pipeline queue for work to do (database dump etc, copy to S3) Much of the functionality has been replaced by Lambda Setup logging to S3 so you can troubleshoot it 8.2 Demonstrate ability to design hybrid cloud architectures Biggest CIDR block you can have is a /16 and smallest is /28 for reservations First four IP addresses and last one are reserved by AWS - always 5 reserved 10.0.0.0 - Network address 10.0.0.1 - Reserved for VPC router 10.0.0.2 - Reserved by AWS for DNS services 10.0.0.3 - Reserved by AWS for future use 10.0.0.255 - Reserved for network broadcast. Network broadcast not supported in a VPC, so this is reserved When migrating to Direct Connect from a VPN, make the VPN connection and Direct Connect connection(s) as part of the same BGP area. Then configure the VPN to have a higher cost than the Direct Connect connection. BGP route prepending will do this as BGP is a metric based protocol. A single ASN is considered a more preferable route than an ASN with three or four values For applications that require multicast, you need to configure a VPN between the EC2 instances with in-instance software, so the underlying AWS infrastructure is not aware of it. Multicast is not supported by AWS VPN network must be a different CIDR block than the underlying instances are using (for example 10.x address for EC2 instances and 172.16.x addresses for VPN connection to another VPC) SQL can be migrated by exporting database as flat files from SQL Management Studio, can't replicate to another region or from on premises to AWS CloudSearch can index documents stored in S3 and is powered by Apache SOLR Can also search DynamoDB with CloudSearch CloudSearch can automatically scale based on load or can be manually scaled ahead of expected load increase Multi-AZ is supported and it's basically a service hosted on EC2, and these are how the costs are derived EMR can be used to run batch processing jobs, such as filtering log files and putting results into S3 EMR uses Hadoop which uses HDFS, a distributed file system across all nodes in the cluster where there are multiple copies of the data, meaning resilience of the data and also enables parallel processing across multiple nodes Hive is used to perform SQL like queries on the data in Hadoop, uses simple syntax to process large data sets Pig is used to write MapReduce programs EMR cluster has three components:- Master node (manages data distribution) Core node (stores data on HDFS from tasks run by task nodes and are managed by the master node) Task nodes (managed by the master node and perform processing tasks only, do not form part of HDFS and pass processed data back to core nodes for storage) EMRFS can be used to output data to S3 instead of HDFS Can use spot, on demand or reserved instances for EMR cluster nodes S3DistCp is an extension of DistCp that is optimized to work with AWS, particularly Amazon S3. You use S3DistCp by adding it as a step in a cluster or at the command line. Using S3DistCp, you can efficiently copy large amounts of data from Amazon S3 into HDFS where it can be processed by subsequent steps in your Amazon EMR cluster Larger data files are more efficient than smaller ones in EMR Storing data persistently on S3 may well be cheaper than leveraging HDFS as large data sets will require large instances sizes in the EMR cluster Smaller EMR cluster with larger nodes may be just as efficient but more cost effective Try to complete jobs within 59 minutes to save money (EMR billed by hour)","Apenas 41% dos profissionais de Tecnologia da Informação acreditam que seus departamentos de TI estão prontos para os negócios digitais dos próximos dois anos, afirma o Gartner. A consultoria consultou 948 clientes em 30 países, entrevistando profissionais de TI de diversas áreas e disciplinas durante o primeiro trimestre dete ano. Para realização do estudo, eles foram questionados sobre suas funções e sobre como as organizações estão tentando se transformar para os desafios dos negócios digitais. A maioria dos profissionais (91%) acredita ter uma função a desempenhar na transformação digital de suas empresas. Entretanto, 59% reconhecem que seus departamentos estão despreparados para os negócios digitais dos próximos dois anos. Conclusões mais recentes destacam uma preocupação real: o desconforto sobre o quão bem os setores de TI estão preparados refletem déficits de habilidade em áreas tecnológicas e não tecnológicas. As áreas de tecnologia consideradas mais influentes nas atividades e carreiras dos profissionais de TI nos próximos 18 meses são Computação em Nuvem, Analytics, Mobilidade e Segurança. Dos profissionais de TI entrevistados, 22% identificaram a Nuvem como a tecnologia que terá o maior impacto em suas carreiras ao longo deste ano. Dados/Analytics foi considerado o segundo item mais popular, com 11% das escolhas. ""Adquirir rapidamente as habilidades de Nuvem é fundamental para que os profissionais de TI possam repensar e reconstruir a infraestrutura de Tecnologia da Informação de suas empresas para melhor possibilitar as estratégias de negócios digitais. Entretanto, não é apenas a Nuvem. Há um conjunto completo de tecnologias e habilidades relacionadas à eficiência que os profissionais de TI devem planejar para o momento"", explica John Hagerty, Vice-Presidente e Analista Emérito do Gartner. O estudo pediu aos profissionais de TI que identificassem até três lacunas nas habilidades que suas organizações estavam tentando preencher com relação aos negócios digitais, de informática ou tecnologia. Nuvem e Dados/Analytics lideraram a lista. Os participantes também apontaram lacunas em habilidades técnicas gerais (indicando falta de conhecimento tecnológico abrangente), bem como nos campos de segurança, modernização de legado, mobilidade e Internet das Coisas. ""Isso, porém, não é somente sobre a tecnologia, pois as principais respostas foram habilidades de eficiência profissional, pensamento crítico, raciocínio e solução de problemas, conhecimento e perspicácia de negócios e habilidades de comunicação"" completa Hagerty. Além disso, 29% disseram que o engajamento com as demandas de negócios digitais deveriam ser seus deveres principais ou uma parte significante de suas atividades. ""Os profissionais de TI indicam que suas prioridades de investimento, alterações de infraestrutura, habilidades de desenvolvimento e interações de negócios com TI estão em fluxo e que eles não têm certeza de como seus departamentos passarão pela transformação digital. Para alguns, as mudanças estão chegando muito rápido, enquanto que para outros isso não está acontecendo"", comenta Hagerty. ""Os profissionais sabem que é preciso mudar, pensar e agir de forma diferente, mas têm dificuldade em se adaptarem ao novo cenário. Da mesma forma, eles consideram difícil equilibrar demandas atuais, como manter as empresas funcionando, com itens essenciais para o futuro"", completa.

The web is centralizing around a handful of large companies that control what we see, limit creative freedom, and capture a lot of information about us. I worry that we risk losing the serendipity, creativity and decentralization that made the open web great. While there are no easy answers to this question, the presentation started a good discussion about the future of the open web, the role of algorithms in society, and how we might be able to take back control of our personal information. I'm going to use my blog to continue the conversation about the open web, since it impacts the future of Drupal . I'm including the video and slides (PDF, 76 MB) of my SxSW presentation below, as well as an overview of what I discussed. Here are the key ideas I discussed in my presentation, along with a few questions to discuss in the comments. Idea 1: An FDA-like organization to provide oversight for algorithms. While an ""FDA"" in and of itself may not be the most ideal solution, algorithms are nearly everywhere in society and are beginning to impact life-or-death decisions. I gave the example of an algorithm for a self-driving car having to decide whether to save the driver or hit a pedestrian crossing the street. There are many other life-or-death examples of how unregulated technology could impact people in the future, and I believe this is an issue we need to begin thinking about now. What do you suggest we do to make the use of algorithms fair and trustworthy? Idea 2: Open standards that will allow for information-sharing across sites and applications. Closed platforms like Facebook and Google are winning because they're able to deliver a superior user experience driven by massive amounts of data and compute power. For the vast majority of people, ease-of-use will trump most concerns around privacy and control. I believe we need to create a set of open standards that enable drastically better information-sharing and integration between websites and applications so independent websites can offer user experiences that meet or exceeds that of the large platforms. How can the Drupal community help solve this problem? Idea 3: A personal information broker that allows people more control over their data. In the past, I've written about the idea for a personal information broker that will give people control over how, where and for how long their data is used, across every single interaction on the web. This is no small feat. An audience member asked an interesting question about who will build this personal information broker -- whether it will be a private company, a government, an NGO, or a non-profit organization? I'm not really sure I have the answer, but I am optimistic that we can figure that out. I wish I had the resources to build this myself as I believe this will be a critical building block for the web. What do you think is the best way forward? Ultimately, we should be building the web that we want to use, and that we want our children to be using for decades to come. It's time to start to rethink the foundations, before it's too late. If we can move any of these ideas forward in a meaningful way, they will impact billions of people, and billions more in the future.","The Aite Group projects the blockchain market could be valued at $400 million by 2019. For that reason, some of the biggest names in banking, industry and technology have entered into the space to evaluate how this technology could change the financial world. IBM and Linux, for instance, have brought together some of the brightest minds in the industry and technology to work on blockchain technology through the Hyperledger Project. The Hyperledger Project is under the umbrella of the Linux Foundation, and seeks to incorporate findings by blockchain projects such as Blockstream, Ripple, Digital Asset Holdings and others in order to make blockchain technology useful for the world's biggest corporations. IBM has also contributed its own code to the project. According to John Wolpert, IBM's Global Blockchain Offering Director, when IBM and Linux began working together on the blockchain project, Linux made clear it wanted to ""disrupt the disruption,"" in part with their findings, as well as the data gathered by projects such as Ripple, Ethereum and others exploring the blockchain. The Linux foundation announced its Hyperledger project on December 17, 2015. Just one day later, 2,300 companies had requested to join. The second-largest open source foundation in the history of open source had only 450 inquiries. ""So, it's either going to be a holy mess or it's going to change the world,"" Wolpert said at The Blockchain Conference in San Francisco presented by Lighthouse Partners. As Wolford puts it, a team of IBMers is ""on a quest"" to understand and ""do something important"" with blockchain technology. ""I don't know why we got this rap in the '70s, way back, that we are not cool, that we're kind of stodgy, and that is not the IBM of my experience,"" Wolpert, who founded the taxi service Flywheel, explained. ""We're the original crazy people. The craziest people are the guys at IBM in the '60s and '70s -- you can imagine what they were doing in the '60s -- they are wild-eyed revolutionaries."" Although this is not the image IBM markets, their work in quantum computing, quantum teleportation and neuro semantic chips count among some of the ""cool stuff"" IBM does, says Wolpert. IBM also approaches projects in the spirit of open innovation, and not proprietarily. ""Our method of operations is open, and it's often our MO to back not-our-thing,"" he said of IBM since the 1990s. Wolpert cites Java as one such project: ""You would not know about Java today if it weren't for IBM."" As a ""pretty young dude,"" Wolpert was in the room when IBM made a billion-dollar decision to back Linux over its own technology. He also cites IBM's work on XML as an example of IBM's dedication to open innovation. Currently, IBM has employees working on crypto-security and distributed systems who have been working on consensus algorithms for their entire careers, some for more than 30 years. ""They're crazy smart, we're planetary, we've gone from a couple of guys in a canoe, to a platoon and approaching an army of people working on blockchain,"" Wolpert said. ""So it feels a lot like my first job at IBM which was making Java real for business."" This has led old and new friends to contact the the multinational technology and consulting corporation. ""Banks who have been calling us constantly ... saying 'What's your view on blockchain?' or 'Hey, let's do a project together on blockchain,'"" Wolpert said. ""We've been doing all these crazy projects on blockchain, every kind of blockchain, and learning a lot, been doing that for a couple years and really started to accelerate last year."" Today, there is a whole unit dedicated to blockchain technology at Linux Foundation. ""We went all-in on blockchain,"" he explained. What's it all about for Wolpert? ""It's about evolving the Internet."" Bitcoin is important for moving money around without a single authority. ""[Bitcoin] is a solution to a problem, a specific problem, of people who need to move money around in environments where you don't trust the government,"" Wolpert said. ""I think we can all agree we are approaching the end of the era where a single authority manages trust and gets compensated for the risk in doing so."" In Wolpert's view, finance does not need to go from today's system of trust -- where consumers trust institutions to handle their money -- to one of complete trustlessness, like the Bitcoin system in which a protocol, not a centralized authority, manages the movement of value. ""It doesn't follow, having one single trust authority to trustlessness on everything,"" he said. ""There is a false dichotomy between the notion of trust and trustlessness, that you have to have a walled garden on one side and Bitcoin on the other."" He doesn't compare Bitcoin to the Internet, saying that's a wrong analogy. ""It is not apt to say the Internet is like Bitcoin; the Internet is, from the perspective of Bitcoin, a permissioned walled garden,"" he said. ""Ever heard of ICANN? It's permissive, but it's permissioned."" Bitcoin, Ripple and Ethereum are ""Iteration 1"" of blockchain technology, the three time IBMer told his audience. Wolpert thinks blockchain technology will soon evolve to ""Iteration 2."" The problem with it? ""The Internet is constrained,"" Wolpert said. ""You have a fabric that allows for lots of competition on platforms and huge amounts of competition on solutions and applications on top of it, so we need to evolve the Internet to become economically aware, and that Internet isn't going to be an application, it is going to be a fabric and then lots of applications on top of that."" This doesn't mean blockchain 2.0 technologies such as Blockstream, Ethereum and Ripple are lost causes that must now completely retool. The Linux Foundation, in fact, works with Ethereum and Ripple employees. With its blockchain projects, IBM is not focused on moving a cryptocurrency. ""Lots of banks pay us lots of money and we like that, and we want to radically improve them,"" Wolpert explained. ""[Bankers] are gonna try like heck to radically improve what is going on ahead of the disruption, disrupt themselves if you will. If you look at things like [Overstock's] t0, that's happening, might happen on Bitcoin protocol, but might not, and there's plenty of ways to solve it, when you commit to it. And sure, Bitcoin has woken [banks] up to this, so it's doing its job, it's disrupting the thinking and maybe that is all that is necessary."" Wolpert wonders aloud during his speech if the world would have iTunes were it not for Napster, or Netflix if it weren't for BitTorrent. The former head of products for IBM's Watson Ecosystem says IBM currently has a ""boomtown with giant numbers of people at IBM and everywhere else"" investigating the blockchain problem and how distributed technology can be made useful for industry. He details how oftentimes IBM tinkers with open innovations itself to make the technology ready for industry. That's not the route being taken with Bitcoin. That the Bitcoin network is on par with Ireland for energy consumption, and that mining consortiums could eventually dictate that market, scares the firm away from dealing directly with Bitcoin. ""What I want to see, what we want to see, is a world full of companies who I can know, who I can identify, who are so spread out, like the Internet,"" he said. Wolpert cites the Arab Spring, and the role the Internet played in that uprising, as how a permissioned, yet permissive, structure functions. Websites, albeit technology permissioned by ICANN, remained online during the protests and played a major role. What's the risk in experimenting with blockchain? ""The risk is we go crazy, we have an unruly mess,"" Wolpert warned. ""[But] it's the Linux Foundation, we've been in this movie before. While there's a lot of really smart guys working on Bitcoin and startups, we've got equally amount of people who also have 20 or 30 years of experience with open source and open innovation, and I think we have a good shot at maintaining restraints, keeping it scoped down, keeping it simple, but getting it to something that is useful."""
